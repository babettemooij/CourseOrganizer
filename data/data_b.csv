HOW requires a description of a desired state of affairs for getting from an existing situation to the desired situation Frank Nack Research – Why and How \x0c Research Question – Types (Blaikie, ; Robson ) Frank Nack Research – Why and How \x0c Research Question – Logic of inquiry Top down Bottom up Frank Nack Research – Why and How \x0c Research Question – Logic of inquiry Inductive for WHAT; weak on answering WHY questions Deductive and retroductive for WHY Abductive for WHAT and WHY Frank Nack Research – Why and How \x0c Research – Literature \x0c Research – Literature Summarize the current state of knowledge in the area of investigation  Empirical state of knowledge: What previous research has been done on this problem?  Theoretical state of knowledge: What are the pertinent theories of the phenomenon? Frank Nack Research – Why and How \x0c Research – Literature Frank Nack Research – Why and How \x0c Literature – Gap and contribution Gap Describing the results of other studies that are closely related to the study being reported What do we know already about the topic? Relating the study to the larger, ongoing dialogue in the literature about a topic, filling in gaps and extending prior studies Contribution What are we going to learn as the result of the proposed project that we do not know now yet? Why is it worth knowing? Who will benefit? Frank Nack Research – Why and How \x0c Literature – Review In reviewing previous work, you need not describe every study ever done with which you are dealing A literature review is a synthesis! Emphasize their major conclusions, findings or relevant methodological issues and avoid unnecessary detail Even when you must describe an entire study, try to condense it as much as possible without sacrificing clarity Frank Nack Research – Why and How \x0c Literature – Priorities Begin with the review of recent conference papers on the topic (often report the latest research developments) Look for major conferences and the papers delivered at them (See ACM digital library) Then look at journal articles in respected, scientific journals that report on research studies Start with most recent studies about the topic, then work backward in time Next review books related to the topic Begin with research monographs Then consider entire books that are on a single topic or that contain chapters written by different authors Frank Nack Research – Why and How \x0c Research – Research Method \x0c Methodology Describe methodology • What will be done to solve the research problem? • What parts of method are standard, which are innovative • What will you actually do? Specify sources of data, steps • Why are tasks outlined best attack on the problem?

cloud wwwcwinl/~boncz/bads \x0c Columnar Compression • Trades I/O for CPU – A winning proposition currently – Even trading RAM bandwidth for CPU wins •  core machines starved for RAM bandwidth • Additional column-store synergy: – Column store: data of the same distribution close together • Better compression rates • Generic compression (gzip) vs Domain-aware compression – Synergy with vectorized processing (see later) compress/decompress/execution, SIMD – Can use extra space to store multiple copies of data in different sort orders (see later) wwwcwinl/~boncz/bads \x0c Run-length

wwwcwinl/~boncz/bads \x0c Differential Encoding • Encodes values as b bit offset from previous value • Special escape code (just like frame of reference encoding) indicates a difference larger than can be stored in b bits – After escape code, original(uncompressed) value is written • Performs well on columns containing increasing/decreasing sequences – inverted lists – timestamps – object IDs –

lscaling with multiple nodes lintegration in cloud wwwcwinl/~boncz/bads \x0c •data is spread based on a Key –Functions: Hash, Range, List •“distribution” –Goal: parallelism • give each compute node a piece of the data • each query has work on every piece (keep everyone busy) •“partitioning” –Goal: data lifecycle management • Data warehouse eg keeps last six months • Every night: load one new day, drop the oldest partition –Goal: improve access patterm • when querying for May, drop Q,Q,Q (“partition pruning”) Table Partitioning and Distribution distribute by hash Q Q Q Q partition by range

\x0c What’s Wrong WithThis PDM? \uf0a2The model assumes that you will build and customers will come \uf0a2Works well in existing markets were competition is understood and customers and their needs are well known(and especially for life and death products) \uf0a2But for most start-ups not really \uf0a2Most startups fail because of lack of customers and cash-flow not because of a lack of product You don’t know if you’re wrong until you’re outofbusiness/money \x0c What’s Wrong WithThis PDM? \uf0a2Process and product focus and lack of customer and market focus \uf0a2Focus on the first customer ship date \uf0a2Emphasis on execution instead of learning and discovering \uf0a2The lack of meaningful milestones for sales, marketing and business development \uf0a2Premature scaling and spending \uf0a2Death Spiral: Cost of getting product launch wrong \uf0a2Not All startups are alike and fit the Product Development Model \x0c Marketing and Sales in thePDM?

\uf0a2Are the sales and business plans realistic, scalable, and achievable? \uf0a2What do we do if our model turns out to be wrong? \x0c So what else if the PDM is wrong? \uf0a2the company has to prove that a market could exist, \uf0a2verify that there are customers who would pay real dollars for the solutions the company envisions \uf0a2then scale up the sales and marketing function and go out and create the market The solution is to have parallel process to product development that is customer-and market-centric: “Customer Development” \x0c The Customer Development Model •Iterative and not sequential process •Initially focused on learning and discovering •Test your hypotheses Two are fundamental: problem and product concept \x0c Customer Discovery \uf0a2who are the customers for your product?

\uf0a3How are you going to reach this customer? \uf0a3How do you drive demand? \uf0a3How will you make money? \x0c Opportunity identificationWhat’s an opportunity? An opportunity, rather than just an idea, will be attractive, timely, durable, and anchored in a product, service, or business that creates or adds value for its buyer or end user An opportunity is: •an idea that has the qualities of being attractive, durable, and timely and is anchored in a product or service •a favorable set of circumstances that creates a need for a new product, service, or business \x0c Opportunity IdentificationThree Ways to Identify an Opportunity Three ways to identify an opportunity are, observing trends, solving a problem, and finding gaps in the marketplace \x0c Observing trends  environmental trends that suggest business, product, or service opportunity gaps The trends are as follows , economic forces, such as state of the economy, level of disposable income, and consumer spending habits , social forces, such as social and cultural trends, demographic changes, and what people think is in fashion , technological advances, such as new technologies, emerging technologies, and new uses of old technologies , political and regulatory changes, such as new changes in political arena and new laws and regulations; all point to business, product or service opportunity gap This difference between what’s available and what’s possible leads to new business, product, and service ideas can lead to new business product or service ideas \x0c \uf0a2Sometimes identifying opportunities simply involves noticing a problem and finding a way to solve it \uf0a2These problems can be pinpointed through observing trends and through more simple means, such as intuition, serendipity or chance \uf0a2Many companies have been started by people who have experienced a problem in their own lives, and then realized that the solution to the problem represented a business opportunity Solving a Problem \x0c Finding Gaps in the Marketplace \uf0a2A gap in the marketplace is often created when a product or service is needed by a specific group of people but doesn’t represent an interesting enough market to be of interest to mainstream retailers or manufacturers \x0c Techniques for Generating Ideas \uf0a2Brainstorming \uf0a2Focus Groups \uf0a2Library and Internet Research \uf0a2Customer Journey analyses \x0c Assignment Tutorial next week \uf0a2Develop an idea \uf0a2Each Team needs to present their initial idea in a PowerPoint presentation, convincing that it can become a “new business opportunity” \uf0a2Make clear why and try to substantiate your convictions Think about What, Who and How? \uf0a2Each team has  minutes (including questions) \x0c Bibliography Barringer, Bruce R and R Duane Ireland, Entrepreneurship, successfully launching new ventures, Pearson,  Blank, Steve, “Why the Lean Start-up changes everything, Harvard Business Review, may , (https://hbrorg///why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything) Blank, Steve, ""The Four Steps to the Epiphany"", chapter : The Path to Epiphany: The Customer Development Model,  (https://webstanfordedu/class/archive/engr/engra/engra/cgi- bin/MFP/wp-content/uploads///Session--Customer-Developmentpdf) Bruns, K, N Bosma, M Sanders, M Schramm, Entrepreneurship, institutions and growth in European regions: a uniform mechanism?,  Kritikos, A Entrepreneurs and their impact on jobs and economic growth IZA World of Labor  Moore, Geoffrey A, Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling High-Tech Products to Mainstream Customers,  Ries, Eric, The Lean Startup: How Today\'s Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses, Crown Publishing",,DDBI

\x0c Executive Summary • The executive summary is a short overview of the entire business plan • It provides everything to be known about the new venture’s distinctive nature • It shouldn’t exceed two single-spaced pages Even though it appears at the beginning of the business plan, it should be written last Why is the summary so important? • GO/NO-GO decision Ex: VCs screen business proposals very rapidly In average less than six minutes on initial screening and less than  minutes on proposal assessment • It is your hook: you need to provide fit with long-term growth and profitability of the industry in which you operate (Hall and Hofer, ) Business plan & financial viability \x0c Industry Analysis and Company description (/) Provide a general description of the company Items to include: • Company history/motivation • Mission (present) • Vision (future) • Products and services • Legal status and ownership • Milestones achieved and position • Key partnerships “HOW you will get to where you want to be” “WHERE you want to be” Business plan & financial viability \x0c Industry Analysis and Company description (/) Describe the industry the business will enter Items to include: • Industry size, growth rate, structure • Nature of participants • Key success factors • Industry trends Source:: https://wwwonlineseu/phase--analysis-context/--swot-analysis/ Business plan & financial viability \x0c Market analysis and economics of the business The market analysis Items: • Market segmentation and target market selection • Description of consumers’ behavior in the market • Competitor analysis and barrier to entry • Market sales’ predictions: • A top-down forecast: given the existing market and potential market growth, your company can expect to capture a certain percentage share • A bottom-up forecast: you start with the basic units of your business (your product, price, customers) and estimate how large you can scale those units • How to get information: find a comparable venture, contact industry associations The economics of the business addresses how profits are earned Items: • Revenue drivers and profit margins (- years prevision) • Fixed (sustained even if the venture does not sell) and variable (vary by sales) costs • Contribution margin per product/service: revenue – costs (fixed and variables) • Operating leverage (fixed/variable costs) and its implications for the Break-even chart Business plan & financial viability \x0c Marketing Plan The marketing plan focuses on how the business will market and sell its product or service • Articulate points of differentiation, and talk about how these overall aspects of the plan will be supported by price, promotional mix and distribution strategy • Ps to As model: Product, Promotion, Price, Place • Acceptability, Affordability, Accessibility and Awareness Design and Operations Plan • Design plan outlines how the business will be run and how product or service will be produced Show a prototype • Describe the business in terms of “back stage” (unseen to the customer) and “front stage” (seen by the customer) activities Other examples: design Graphical user interface or use Business Process Model and Notation Business plan & financial viability \x0c Management team and overall schedule It is fundament to present the skills of the management team since many investors read the executive summary and then go directly to the management team section to assess the strength of the people starting the venture You can prepare a schedule in the format of milestones critical to the business’s success (Gantt diagram) Examples of milestones: • Incorporating the venture • Completion of prototypes • Rental of facilities • Obtaining critical financing • Starting production • Obtaining the first sale Source: wwwofficetimelinecom/gantt-chart-template Business plan & financial viability \x0c Avoiding mistakes  Neglecting theresearch component Your idea is significant, but ideas are confined to

but that vague language isn’t going to cutitforserious investors andpotentialpartners  Writing in aclosedsystem You came up with your idea, you did some Google searches to find data supporting your idea, and you spent weeks fleshing out the entire business plan It’s comprehensive, well-researched, and well-written, but there’s oneproblem:youwroteinaclosed system Getoutsideopinions  Boringyourreader The term business plan makes this document seem boring, thus make your plan more exciting wherever you can Talk about the possibilities for future expansion Show you are passionate for the idea Write colloquially andinformally,whenappropriate,toreachyour audiencedirectly  Forgetting the reality Consider always what investors and banks are asking for Re-organize your plan accordingto theirtemplates Example Barclays and ING bank Business plan & financial viability \x0c Few advices (/) Customize your business plan: -Bankers stress the financial aspects of the proposal and give less emphasis to market, entrepreneur or other issues -As equity investors, venture capital managers and business angels have a very different approach, emphasizing both market and finance issues -Business angels give emphasis on the entrepreneur and ‘investor fit’ considerations: • the relationships among the investor’s background, the investment opportunity and your team; • the investor’s preferences (ie is this an industry, market, etc that the investor wants to be in?) (Mason and Stark, ) Be critical with your plan and spend time to assess others’ business plans to increase your experience Business plan & financial viability \x0c Few advices (/) Have the courage to differentiate your idea when there is already a market leader Tinder is a leading location-based social mobile app that facilitates meetings between interested users It has more than  mil downloads,  mil users,  countries JMP Securities predicts Tinder to be worth $ billion Is it possible to compete? Nowadays Tinder has at least  big competitors! Few examples: Okcupid ( millions users) On Tinder, the only thing that matters is ‘Look’ On Okcupid there is the filter the searches based on hobbies and appearances Happn ( millions users) On Tinder, the users get to see the matches on the basis of the current location of the users Happn lets the users to match with the fellow users they have crossed their paths with Clover ( million users) Clover allows the user to set up real dates with on-demand features (discovering the local events, single events, meetups, and parties) Source:

managing the organization’s finances to achieve the highest rate of return To answers questions like: • Is the company in a financial good shape? • Is the company efficiently utilizing assets and cash? • An organization can track its financial progress preparing and maintaining past financial statements • An organization can forecast future income and expenses by preparing pro forma (projected) financial statements Business plan & financial viability \x0c Financial Objectives Source: R Barringer and RD Ireland,  Business plan & financial viability \x0c The Process of Financial Management “Accounting is the language of business” (W Buffet) Established companies rely on three financial statements to evaluate their financial health: • The income statement: • The balance sheet; • The statement of cash flows New companies can start with: • Forecasts: estimate of future (- years) • Based on industry averages or the experiences of similar start-ups • Budget estimation: a micro level analysis of expenses and capital needs Business plan & financial viability \x0c The Process of Financial Management Reflect past performance and are usually prepared on a quarterly and annual basis They mirror elements and strategies of the business plan Are projections for future periods based on forecasts and are typically completed for two to three years in the future Source: R Barringer and RD Ireland,  Business plan & financial viability \x0c Three types of historical financial statements Financial Statement Income Statement Balance Sheet Statement of cash flows Purpose Reflects the results of the operations of a company over a specified period It records all revenues and expenses for the given period, showing profit or loss Is a snapshot of a company’s assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity at a specific point in time Summarizes the changes in a company\'s cash position for a specified period and details why the changes occurred Business plan & financial viability \x0c Simulation: New Venture Fitness Drinks To illustrate how financial statements are prepared, we used New Venture Fitness Drinks: • New Venture Fitness Drinks has been in business for

• -Month Cash Flow (budget) • Break-even (in sales) • Financial performance of similar businesses • Simple observational research may be needed • Overall financial attractiveness associated with promising opportunities • The possibility of a rapid growth in sales during the first  to  years in a defined market • High percentage of recurring revenues • Ability to forecast income and expenses

What is the company\'s contribution margin perunit? Contribution margin is price minus total variable expenses Thus,  What is the break-even point in units? The break-even in units is: fixed total expenses divided by contribution margin, thus , units If the company wants to earn a profit of $, instead of breaking even, what is the number ofunits the company must sell? Fixed Expenses of $, + Desired Profit of$, = $, Thus, divide $, by the Contribution Margin perunit ($) You obtain the number of units that will generate aprofit of $,, such as , units Business plan & financial viability \x0c Break even analysis (in sales) What is the company\'s contribution margin ratio? The contribution margin ratio is the contribution margin expressed as a percentage of sales If the variable expenses are % (%+%+%) of sales Thus, the contribution margin ratio is %-%, such as % What is the break-even point in dollars? Fixed expenses of $, divided by the contribution margin ratio of % = $, If the company wants to earn a profit of $, instead of breaking even, what is the amount of sales dollars the company must achieve? $, (Try to figure out the calculation process, reading the example of the previous slide) Business plan & financial viability \x0c The break-even chart Personal re- elaboration Blue: profit Red: loss Business plan & financial viability \x0c Thank you for your attention I wish you a good presentation !

Source: R Barringer and RD Ireland,  \x0c Commercial Banks • Historically, commercial banks have not been viewed as a practical source of financing for start-up firms • Banks are risk averse, and financing start-ups is a risky business • Banks are interested in firms that have a strong cash flow, low leverage, audited financials, good management, and a healthy balance sheet • They perform different types of loan, for example: • Fixed-purpose (capital + interest) • Line of credit (periodic interest payment, an “upper limit cap”, etc) Getting financing or funding \x0c Business Angels • Individuals who invest their personal capital directly in start-ups • Identikit:  years old, has succeeded as an entrepreneur, still interested in the start-up process • They make relatively small investments: • In US they generally invest between $, and $, in a single company • Are looking for companies that have the potential to grow (revenues) between % to % per year • For Netherlands,

capital funds are called limited partners They pay a fee and obtain part (%) profits • The venture capitalists who manage the funds are called general partners They receive the fee and the rest of the profits • Ex of limited partners: wealthy individuals, pension plans, university endowments, foreign investors, foundations, insurance companies • An important part of obtaining venture capital funding is going through the due diligence process • They invest money in “stages,” meaning that not all the money invested is disbursed at the same time • For Netherlands, check Banker Bay and Venture capital Getting financing or funding \x0c Capital funding in Stages • Seed Stage: business ideas that are able to begin operations but are not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales (prototype and feasibility analysis) • Start-up stage: Companies organized but have not yet sold their product in themarketplace (Management is in place and there is a business model) • First-stage funding: capital is provided to initiate commercial manufacturing and sales The company has a product in testing or pilot production • Second-stage funding: the product is in production and is commercially available The company demonstrates significant revenue growth, but may or may not be showing a profit (it needs to expand its market) • Mezzanine financing: there are profits Financing is necessary to further expand This stage represents a bridge between expanding the company and the IPO or buyout • Buyout stage: funding provided to help one company acquire another Getting financing or funding \x0c Initial Public Offering • An initial public offering (IPO) is a company’s first sale of stock to the public When a company goes public, its stock is traded on one of the major stock exchanges (Euronext for Netherlands) • Most entrepreneurial firms that go public trade on the NASDAQ, which is weighted heavily toward technology, biotech, and small-company stocks • Important milestone for a firm • Main reasons to perform an IPO: • Is a way to raise equity capital to fund current and future operations • Raises a firm’s public profile, attracting high-quality customers and business partners • Is a liquidity event that provides a means for investors to recoup their investments • Creates a form of currency that can be used to grow the company via acquisitions Getting financing or funding \x0c Timeline Funding IPO Venture Capital Business Angels Commercial Banks Source: Adioma/foundersandfounderscom Getting financing or funding \x0c A pitch as strategy? Step  Describe the opportunity or problem to be solved Describe how your product meets the Step  opportunity or solves the problem Step  Describe your qualifications During a pitch “preparedness” and “cognitive legitimacy” are Step  Describe your market involved (Pollack et al, ) • Preparedness is accumulated learning that individuals bring to the new venture creation process (Cope, ) • Cognitive legitimacy is the assessment that organizational activities are proper or appropriate because they match pre-constructed beliefs about ways organizations work (Suchman, ) Getting financing or funding \x0c Creative source: Crowdfunding Main types: • In rewards-based crowdfunding, backers give a small amount of money in exchange for a reward (Ex: Kickstarter, Indiegogo, RocketHub, etc) • In equity crowdfunding, investors invest large amounts of money in a company in exchange for a small piece of equity in the company (Ex: Companisto, Crowdcube, Fundedbyme) • In donation-based crowdfunding, donors donate a small amount of money in exchange for gratitude and the feeling of supporting a cause they believe in (Ex: Tilt, GoFundMe, etc) • And in debt crowdfunding, lenders make a loan with the expectation to make back their principal plus interest (Ex: Landing club, prosper, Upstart, etc) • For Netherlands, check: Douw&Koren Is it really working? Kickstarter reports that on , reward-based projects only  percent of those projects actually received funding Getting financing or funding \x0c Why so popular? Convenience • Compared to all of the paperwork and preparation needed for loans, setting a crowdfunding campaign is a breeze “Investors and entrepreneurs can discover each other” Validates a Concept • It provides a great opportunity to see where the market stands “Having an idea is one thing Proving that the idea can make a profit is another thing” Reduces Risk • It validates the market, both entrepreneurs and investors don’t have to worry about taking on as much risk “You only sell what’s been ordered” Real-time Feedback • You can create polls or surveys to see what people enjoy or don’t like about your product This can help you make the right adjustments faster than what it would have been in the past “Getting your product to market as soon as possible” A Great Marketing Tool • As you share your campaign across multiple social media channels, you’re able to build a following of loyal customers before the business has even launched “Free advertising” Getting financing or funding \x0c Crowdfunding strategies / Convey the right financial picture • Set a reasonable funding goal (smaller amounts are manageable) • Run All-Or-Nothing campaigns (threshold pledge model) • Give Expense Details (removing ambiguity) • Present Financial Projections (roadmap of the project) • Adjust Request Sizes (small amounts attract reluctant investors) Decrease Perceived Risk • Offer Warranties (reduce risk) • Don’t incentivize the Group Leader (team project) Source:https://thecreativityhabitcom/amand a-palmer-art-of-asking/ Appeal to their Altruistic side • Highlight project’s creative details (innovativeness pays) • Label investors with positive characteristics (consistent behaviour) • Arouse empathy by expressing feelings (check Amanda Palmer case: link) Getting financing or funding \x0c Crowdfunding strategies / Source: https://nuvopreneurcom/crowdfunding-top-strategies-tactics/ Increase your credibility • Highlight previous Experience (be professional) • Donate to other projects (be fair) • Convey qualification of Management Team (signal quality) • Put Internal Governance in Place (increase confidence) • Incorporate a Company (increase trust) • Offer meaningful rewards (prefer reward-based) • Introduce your team (improve credibility) • Keep Investors Updated (improve credibility) Put your Marketing in place • Use Images in your Pitch (a picture is worth a  words) • Use videos in your pitch (grab the viewer’s attention in the first  seconds) • Use positive sentiments in your pitch (empathy) • Communicate the uniqueness of your project (differentiation) • Leverage your Social Network (power of social capital) Getting financing or funding \x0c Is it always rational?
