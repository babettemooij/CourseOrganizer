# CourseOrganizer

<p>This website is a simple tool made for a course in the MSc programme Information Studies at the University of Amsterdam. It organizes documents uploaded to Canvas. When a user clicks on a document preview, it opens a new tab with more information about the specific document. This includes the embedded document itself. For copyright reasons, we can't upload the PDF's to a public Github. <strong> For full use of the website, the project group provides a link to a directory containing all documents. This folder can be downloaded and put in place of the "pdfs" directory. </strong> </p>
