An opportunity, rather than just an idea, will be attractive, timely, durable, and anchored in a product, service, or business that creates or adds value for its buyer or end user An opportunity is: •an idea that has the qualities of being attractive, durable, and timely and is anchored in a product or service •a favorable set of circumstances that creates a need for a new product, service, or business \x0c Opportunity IdentificationThree Ways to Identify an Opportunity Three ways to identify an opportunity are, observing trends, solving a problem, and finding gaps in the marketplace \x0c Observing trends  environmental trends that suggest business, product, or service opportunity gaps The trends are as follows , economic forces, such as state of the economy, level of disposable income, and consumer spending habits , social forces, such as social and cultural trends, demographic changes, and what people think is in fashion , technological advances, such as new technologies, emerging technologies, and new uses of old technologies , political and regulatory changes, such as new changes in political arena and new laws and regulations; all point to business, product or service opportunity gap This difference between what’s available and what’s possible leads to new business, product, and service ideas can lead to new business product or service ideas \x0c \uf0a2Sometimes identifying opportunities simply involves noticing a problem and finding a way to solve it \uf0a2These problems can be pinpointed through observing trends and through more simple means, such as intuition, serendipity or chance \uf0a2Many companies have been started by people who have experienced a problem in their own lives, and then realized that the solution to the problem represented a business opportunity Solving a Problem \x0c Finding Gaps in the Marketplace \uf0a2A gap in the marketplace is often created when a product or service is needed by a specific group of people but doesn’t represent an interesting enough market to be of interest to mainstream retailers or manufacturers \x0c Techniques for Generating Ideas \uf0a2Brainstorming \uf0a2Focus Groups \uf0a2Library and Internet Research \uf0a2Customer Journey analyses \x0c Assignment Tutorial next week \uf0a2Develop an idea \uf0a2Each Team needs to present their initial idea in a PowerPoint presentation, convincing that it can become a “new business opportunity” \uf0a2Make clear why and try to substantiate your convictions Think about What, Who and How? \uf0a2Each team has  minutes (including questions) \x0c Bibliography Barringer, Bruce R and R Duane Ireland, Entrepreneurship, successfully launching new ventures, Pearson,  Blank, Steve, “Why the Lean Start-up changes everything, Harvard Business Review, may , (https://hbrorg///why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything) Blank, Steve, ""The Four Steps to the Epiphany"", chapter : The Path to Epiphany: The Customer Development Model,  (https://webstanfordedu/class/archive/engr/engra/engra/cgi- bin/MFP/wp-content/uploads///Session--Customer-Developmentpdf) Bruns, K, N Bosma, M Sanders, M Schramm, Entrepreneurship, institutions and growth in European regions: a uniform mechanism?,  Kritikos, A Entrepreneurs and their impact on jobs and economic growth IZA World of Labor  Moore, Geoffrey A, Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling High-Tech Products to Mainstream Customers,  Ries, Eric, The Lean Startup: How Today\'s Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses, Crown Publishing",,DDBI,"product, service, customer, business, market, opportunity, uf, idea, company, change",Entrepreneurship

\x0c Executive Summary • The executive summary is a short overview of the entire business plan • It provides everything to be known about the new venture’s distinctive nature • It shouldn’t exceed two single-spaced pages Even though it appears at the beginning of the business plan, it should be written last Why is the summary so important? • GO/NO-GO decision Ex: VCs screen business proposals very rapidly In average less than six minutes on initial screening and less than  minutes on proposal assessment • It is your hook: you need to provide fit with long-term growth and profitability of the industry in which you operate (Hall and Hofer, ) Business plan & financial viability \x0c Industry Analysis and Company description (/) Provide a general description of the company Items to include: • Company history/motivation • Mission (present) • Vision (future) • Products and services • Legal status and ownership • Milestones achieved and position • Key partnerships “HOW you will get to where you want to be” “WHERE you want to be” Business plan & financial viability \x0c Industry Analysis and Company description (/) Describe the industry the business will enter Items to include: • Industry size, growth rate, structure • Nature of participants • Key success factors • Industry trends Source:: https://wwwonlineseu/phase--analysis-context/--swot-analysis/ Business plan & financial viability \x0c Market analysis and economics of the business The market analysis Items: • Market segmentation and target market selection • Description of consumers’ behavior in the market • Competitor analysis and barrier to entry • Market sales’ predictions: • A top-down forecast: given the existing market and potential market growth, your company can expect to capture a certain percentage share • A bottom-up forecast: you start with the basic units of your business (your product, price, customers) and estimate how large you can scale those units • How to get information: find a comparable venture, contact industry associations The economics of the business addresses how profits are earned Items: • Revenue drivers and profit margins (- years prevision) • Fixed (sustained even if the venture does not sell) and variable (vary by sales) costs • Contribution margin per product/service: revenue – costs (fixed and variables) • Operating leverage (fixed/variable costs) and its implications for the Break-even chart Business plan & financial viability \x0c Marketing Plan The marketing plan focuses on how the business will market and sell its product or service • Articulate points of differentiation, and talk about how these overall aspects of the plan will be supported by price, promotional mix and distribution strategy • Ps to As model: Product, Promotion, Price, Place • Acceptability, Affordability, Accessibility and Awareness Design and Operations Plan • Design plan outlines how the business will be run and how product or service will be produced Show a prototype • Describe the business in terms of “back stage” (unseen to the customer) and “front stage” (seen by the customer) activities Other examples: design Graphical user interface or use Business Process Model and Notation Business plan & financial viability \x0c Management team and overall schedule It is fundament to present the skills of the management team since many investors read the executive summary and then go directly to the management team section to assess the strength of the people starting the venture You can prepare a schedule in the format of milestones critical to the business’s success (Gantt diagram) Examples of milestones: • Incorporating the venture • Completion of prototypes • Rental of facilities • Obtaining critical financing • Starting production • Obtaining the first sale Source: wwwofficetimelinecom/gantt-chart-template Business plan & financial viability \x0c Avoiding mistakes  Neglecting theresearch component Your idea is significant, but ideas are confined to

idea, and you spent weeks fleshing out the entire business plan It’s comprehensive, well-researched, and well-written, but there’s oneproblem:youwroteinaclosed system Getoutsideopinions  Boringyourreader The term business plan makes this document seem boring, thus make your plan more exciting wherever you can Talk about the possibilities for future expansion Show you are passionate for the idea Write colloquially andinformally,whenappropriate,toreachyour audiencedirectly  Forgetting the reality Consider always what investors and banks are asking for Re-organize your plan accordingto theirtemplates Example Barclays and ING bank Business plan & financial viability \x0c Few advices (/) Customize your business plan: -Bankers stress the financial aspects of the proposal and give less emphasis to market, entrepreneur or other issues -As equity investors, venture capital managers and business angels have a very different approach, emphasizing both market and finance issues -Business angels give emphasis on the entrepreneur and ‘investor fit’ considerations: • the relationships among the investor’s background, the investment opportunity and your team; • the investor’s preferences (ie is this an industry, market, etc that the investor wants to be in?) (Mason and Stark, ) Be critical with your plan and spend time to assess others’ business plans to increase your experience Business plan & financial viability \x0c Few advices (/) Have the courage to differentiate your idea when there is already a market leader Tinder is a leading location-based social mobile app that facilitates meetings between interested users It has more than  mil downloads,  mil users,  countries JMP Securities predicts Tinder to be worth $ billion Is it possible to compete? Nowadays Tinder has at least  big competitors! Few examples: Okcupid ( millions users) On Tinder, the only thing that matters is ‘Look’ On Okcupid there is the filter the searches based on hobbies and appearances Happn ( millions users) On Tinder, the users get to see the matches on the basis of the current location of the users Happn lets the users to match with the fellow users they have crossed their paths with Clover ( million users) Clover

managing the organization’s finances to achieve the highest rate of return To answers questions like: • Is the company in a financial good shape? • Is the company efficiently utilizing assets and cash? • An organization can track its financial progress preparing and maintaining past financial statements • An organization can forecast future income and expenses by preparing pro forma (projected) financial statements Business plan & financial viability \x0c Financial Objectives Source: R Barringer and RD Ireland,  Business plan & financial viability \x0c The Process of Financial Management “Accounting is the language of business” (W Buffet) Established companies rely on three financial statements to evaluate their financial health: • The income statement: • The balance sheet; • The statement of cash flows New companies can start with: • Forecasts: estimate of future (- years) • Based on industry averages or the experiences of similar start-ups • Budget estimation: a micro level analysis of expenses and capital needs Business plan & financial viability \x0c The Process of Financial Management Reflect past performance and are usually prepared on a quarterly and annual basis They mirror elements and strategies of the business plan Are projections for future periods based on forecasts and are typically completed for two to three years in the future Source: R Barringer and RD Ireland,  Business plan & financial viability \x0c Three types of historical financial statements Financial Statement Income Statement Balance Sheet Statement of cash flows Purpose Reflects the results of the operations of a company over a specified period It records all revenues and expenses for the given period, showing profit or loss Is a snapshot of a company’s assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity at a specific point in time Summarizes the changes in a company\'s cash position for a specified period and details why the changes occurred Business plan & financial viability \x0c Simulation: New Venture Fitness Drinks To illustrate how financial statements are prepared, we used New Venture Fitness Drinks: • New Venture Fitness Drinks has been in business for five years • Targeting sports enthusiasts, the company sells a line of nutritional fitness drinks • The company’s strategy is to place small restaurants, similar Source: R Barringer and RD Ireland,

Source: R Barringer and RD Ireland,  \x0c Pro Forma Financial Statements Pro Forma Financial Statements are similar to its historical financial statements except that they look forward rather than track the past • They help develop strategies and make adjustments if necessary • The same financial ratios can be used to evaluate the pro forma financial statements Financial Statement Purpose Pro Forma Income Shows the projected financial results of the Statement operations of a firm over a specific period Shows a projected snapshot of a company’s Pro Forma assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity at a Balance Sheet specific point in time Pro Forma Statement Shows the projected flow of cash into and out of a of Cash flows company for a specific period Business plan & financial viability \x0c Financial projections A preliminary financial assessment, based on estimate, is sufficient Three components: • Projections • -Month Profit and Loss Projection (equivalent to the income statement) • -Month Cash Flow (budget) • Break-even (in sales) • Financial performance of similar businesses • Simple observational research may be needed • Overall financial attractiveness associated with promising opportunities • The possibility of a rapid growth in sales during the first  to  years in a defined market • High percentage of recurring revenues • Ability to forecast income and expenses with a reasonable degree of certainty • Availability of an exit opportunity for investors in order to convert equity to cash Business plan & financial viability \x0c Break even analysis (in units) What is the company\'s contribution margin perunit? Contribution margin is price minus total variable expenses Thus,  What is the break-even point in units? The break-even in units is: fixed total expenses divided by contribution margin, thus , units If the company wants to earn a profit of $, instead of breaking even, what is the number ofunits the company must sell? Fixed Expenses of $, + Desired Profit of$, = $, Thus, divide $, by the Contribution Margin perunit ($) You obtain the number of units that will generate aprofit of $,, such as , units Business plan & financial viability \x0c Break even analysis (in sales) What is the company\'s contribution margin ratio? The contribution margin ratio is the contribution margin expressed as a percentage of sales If the variable expenses are % (%+%+%) of sales Thus, the contribution margin ratio is %-%, such as % What is the break-even point in dollars? Fixed expenses of $, divided by the contribution margin ratio of % = $, If the company wants to earn a profit of $, instead of breaking even, what is the amount of sales dollars the company must achieve? $, (Try to figure out the calculation process, reading the example of the previous slide) Business plan & financial viability \x0c The break-even chart Personal re- elaboration Blue: profit Red: loss Business plan & financial viability \x0c Thank you for your attention I wish you a good presentation !

Source: R Barringer and RD Ireland,  \x0c Commercial Banks • Historically, commercial banks have not been viewed as a practical source of financing for start-up firms • Banks are risk averse, and financing start-ups is a risky business • Banks are interested in firms that have a strong cash flow, low leverage, audited financials, good management, and a healthy balance sheet • They perform different types of loan, for example: • Fixed-purpose (capital + interest) • Line of credit (periodic interest payment, an “upper limit cap”, etc) Getting financing or funding \x0c Business Angels • Individuals who invest their personal capital directly in start-ups • Identikit:  years old, has succeeded as an entrepreneur, still interested in the start-up process • They make relatively small investments: • In US they generally invest between $, and $, in a single company • Are looking for companies that have the potential to grow (revenues) between % to % per year • For Netherlands,

capital funds are called limited partners They pay a fee and obtain part (%) profits • The venture capitalists who manage the funds are called general partners They receive the fee and the rest of the profits • Ex of limited partners: wealthy individuals, pension plans, university endowments, foreign investors, foundations, insurance companies • An important part of obtaining venture capital funding is going through the due diligence process • They invest money in “stages,” meaning that not all the money invested is disbursed at the same time • For Netherlands, check Banker Bay and Venture capital Getting financing or funding \x0c Capital funding in Stages • Seed Stage: business ideas that are able to begin operations but are not yet at the stage of commercial manufacturing and sales (prototype and feasibility analysis) • Start-up stage: Companies organized but have not yet sold their product in themarketplace (Management is in place and there is a business model) • First-stage funding: capital is provided to initiate commercial manufacturing and sales The company has a product in testing or pilot production • Second-stage funding: the product is in production and is commercially available The company demonstrates significant revenue growth, but may or may not be showing a profit (it needs to expand its market) • Mezzanine financing: there are profits Financing is necessary to further expand This stage represents a bridge between expanding the company and the IPO or buyout • Buyout stage: funding provided to help one company acquire another Getting financing or funding \x0c Initial Public Offering • An initial public offering (IPO) is a company’s first sale of stock to the public When a company goes public, its stock is traded on one of the major stock exchanges (Euronext for Netherlands) • Most entrepreneurial firms that go public trade on the NASDAQ, which is weighted heavily toward technology, biotech, and small-company stocks • Important milestone for a firm • Main reasons to perform an IPO: • Is a way to raise equity capital to fund current and future operations • Raises a firm’s public profile, attracting high-quality customers and business partners • Is a liquidity event that provides a means for investors to recoup their investments • Creates a form of currency that can be used to grow the company via

Integration of machine learning with clinical decision support tools, such as computerized alerts or diagnostic support, may offer physicians and others who provide health care targeted and timely information that can improve clinical decisions. Machine learning algorithms, however, may also be subject to biases. The biases include those related to missing data and patients not identified by algorithms, sample size and underestimation, and misclassification and measurement error. There is concern that biases and deficiencies in the data used by machine learning algorithms may contribute to socioeconomic disparities in health care. This Special Communication outlines the potential biases that may be introduced into machine learning–based clinical decision support tools that use electronic health record data and proposes potential solutions to the problems of overreliance on automation, algorithms based on biased data, and algorithms that do not provide information that is clinically meaningful. Existing health care disparities should not be amplified by thoughtless or excessive reliance on machines.",,DM,"datum, word, set, base, topic, analysis, data, class, document, dataset",Natural Language Processing

We applied and tested the CRISP-DM methodology in a response modeling application project. The final goal of the project was to specify a process which can be reliably and efficiently repeated by different people and adapted to different situations. The initial projects were performed by experienced data mining people; future projects are to be performed by people with lower technical skills and with very little time to experiment with different approaches. It turned out, that the CRISP-DM methodology with its distinction of generic and specialized process models provides both the structure and the flexibility necessary to suit the needs of both groups. The generic CRISP-DM process model is useful for planning, communication within and outside the project team, and documentation. The generic check-lists are helpful even for experienced people.

The error of such an estimator can be broken down into bias and variance components. While unbiasedness is often cited as a beneficial quality of a model selection criterion, we demonstrate that a low variance is at least as important, as a nonnegligible variance introduces the potential for over-fitting in model selection as well as in training the model. While this observation is in hindsight perhaps rather obvious, the degradation in performance due to over-fitting the model selection criterion can be surprisingly large, an observation that appears to have received little attention in the machine learning literature to date. In this paper, we show that the effects of this form of over-fitting are often of comparable magnitude to differences in performance between learning algorithms, and thus cannot be ignored in empirical evaluation. Furthermore, we show that some common performance evaluation practices are susceptible to a form of selection bias as a result of this form of over-fitting and hence are unreliable. We discuss methods to avoid over-fitting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation, which we hope will be incorporated into best practice. While this study concentrates on cross-validation based model selection, the findings are quite general and apply to any model selection practice involving the optimisation of a model selection criterion evaluated over a finite sample of data, including maximisation of the Bayesian evidence and optimisation of performance bounds.","model selection, performance evaluation, bias-variance trade-off, selection bias, overfitting",DM,"problem, model, time, solution, optimization, find, decision, lecture, project, give",Optimization

To investigate this question, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 data analysts. We characterize common exploration goals: profiling (assessing data quality) and discovery (gaining new insights). Though the EDA literature primarily emphasizes discovery, we observe that discovery only reliably occurs in the context of open-ended analyses, whereas all participants engage in profiling across all of their analyses. We describe the process and challenges of EDA highlighted by our interviews. We find that analysts must perform repetitive tasks (e.g., examine numerous variables), yet they may have limited time or lack domain knowledge to explore data. Analysts also often have to consult other stakeholders and oscillate between exploration and other tasks, such as acquiring and wrangling additional data. Based on these observations, we identify design opportunities for exploratory analysis tools, such as augmenting exploration with automation and guidance.","Human-centered computing, Visualization, Visualization techniques, Treemaps; Human-centered computing, Visualization, Visualization design and evaluation methods",DM,"research, user, study, social, question, design, model, theory, information, qualitative",Data Research

The interest in prediction methods for scorecard development is unbroken. However, there have been several advancements including novel learning methods, performance measures and techniques to reliably compare different classifiers, which the credit scoring literature does not reflect. To close these research gaps, we update the study of Baesens et al. and compare several novel classification algorithms to the state-of-the-art in credit scoring. In addition, we examine the extent to which the assessment of alternative scorecards differs across established and novel indicators of predictive accuracy. Finally, we explore whether more accurate classifiers are managerial meaningful. Our study provides valuable insight for professionals and academics in credit scoring. It helps practitioners to stay abreast of technical advancements in predictive modeling. From an academic point of view, the study provides an independent assessment of recent scoring methods and offers a new baseline to which future approaches can be compared.","Data Mining, Credit Scoring, OR in banking, Forecasting benchmark",DM,"research, user, study, social, question, design, model, theory, information, qualitative",Data Research

Insights from such pattern analysis offer vast benefits, including increased revenue, cost cutting, and improved competitive advantage. However, the hidden patterns of the frequent item sets become more time consuming to be mined when the amount of data increases over the time. Moreover, significant memory consumption is needed in mining the hidden patterns of the frequent items ets due to a heavy computation by the algorithm. Therefore, an efficient algorithm is required to mine the hidden patterns of the frequent item sets within a shorter runtime and with less memory consumption while the volume of data increases over the time period. This paper reviews and presents a comparison of different algorithms for Frequent Pattern Mining (FPM) so that a more efficient FPM algorithm can be developed.","Data analytics, Data mining, Frequent Pattern Mining (FPM), Frequent itemset mining (FIM)",DM,"research, user, study, social, question, design, model, theory, information, qualitative",Data Research

This article reviews different techniques that can be used for each of these three subtasks and discusses the main advantages and disadvantages of each technique with references to theoretical and empirical studies. Further, recommendations are given to encourage best yet feasible practices in research and applications of machine learning. Common methods such as the holdout method for model evaluation and selection are covered, which are not recommended when working with small datasets. Different flavors of the bootstrap technique are introduced for estimating the uncertainty of performance estimates, as an alternative to confidence intervals via normal approximation if bootstrapping is computationally feasible. Common cross-validation techniques such as leave-oneout cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation are reviewed, the bias-variance trade-off for choosing k is discussed, and practical tips for the optimal choice of k are given based on empirical evidence. Different statistical tests for algorithm comparisons are presented, and strategies for dealing with multiple comparisons such as omnibus tests and multiple-comparison corrections are discussed. Finally, alternative methods for algorithm selection, such as the combined F -test 5x2 crossvalidation and nested cross-validation, are recommended for comparing machine learning algorithms when datasets are small.",,DM,"research, user, study, social, question, design, model, theory, information, qualitative",Data Research

Gaps between the design and operation of algorithms and our understanding of their ethical implications can have severe consequences affecting individuals as well as groups and whole societies.

A sustainable society as a service Can each human be provided with what is needed/wished for in a sustainable manner? Which role does technology then plays? Definitions Society Sustainability Technology Society The term ""society"" came from the Latin word societas, which in turn was derived from the noun socius (""comrade, friend, ally""; adjectival form socialis) used to describe a bond or interaction between parties that are friendly, or at least civil Without an article, the term can refer to the entirety of humanity (also: ""society in general"", ""society at large"", etc), although those who are unfriendly or uncivil to the remainder of society in this sense may be deemed to be ""antisocial"" The Scottish economist, Adam Smith taught instead

https://wwwtescom/lessons/WPzj_OOAjbYhA/thomas-hobbes-presentation Capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit Characteristics central to capitalism include private property, capital accumulation, wage labor, voluntary exchange, a price system and competitive markets In a capitalist market economy, decision-making and investments are determined by every owner of wealth, property or production ability in financial and capital markets, whereas prices and the distribution of goods and services are mainly determined by competition in goods and services markets These include laissez-faire or free-market capitalism, welfare capitalism and state capitalism Different forms of capitalism feature varying degrees of free markets, public ownership obstacles to free competition and state-sanctioned social policies The degree of competition in markets, the role of intervention and regulation, and the scope of state ownership vary across different models of capitalism https://wwwforbescom/sites/cognitiveworld////surveillance-capitalism-a nd-anti-capitalism/#ba Henri de Saint-Simon ( – ) coined the term “Socialism” as a contrast to the liberal doctrine of ”individualism” that emphasized the moral worth of the individual whilst stressing that people act or should act as if they are in isolation from one another The socialist political movement includes a set of political philosophies that originated in the revolutionary movements of the mid- to-late th century and out of concern for the social problems that were associated with capitalism By the late th century, after the work of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, socialism had come to signify opposition to capitalism and advocacy for a post-capitalist system based on some form of social ownership of the means of production Socialism is a political, social and economic philosophy encompassing a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership of the means of production and workers\' self- management of enterprises Social ownership can be public, collective, cooperative or of equity While no single definition encapsulates the many types of socialism, social ownership is the one common element It aims to circumvent the inefficiencies and crises traditionally associated with capital accumulation and the profit system in capitalism Communism is a philosophical, social, political, economic ideology and movement whose ultimate goal is to establish a socioeconomic order structured upon the ideas of common ownership of the means of production and the absence of social classes, money and the state Communism includes a variety of schools of thought (eg Marxism, Leninism, Trotskyism, Stalinism, Maoism, Anarch-communism) While the emergence of the Soviet Union as the world\'s first nominally communist state led to communism\'s widespread association with the Soviet economic model and Marxism–Leninism, some economists and intellectuals argued that in practice the model functioned as a form of state capitalism, or a non-planned administrative or command economy Surveillance capitalism is no more limited to advertising than mass production was limited to the fabrication of the Ford Model T It quickly became the default model for capital accumulation in Silicon Valley, embraced by nearly every startup and app By now it’s no longer restricted to individual companies or even to the internet sector It has spread across a wide range of products, services, and economic sectors, including insurance, retail, healthcare, finance, entertainment, education, transportation, and more, birthing whole new ecosystems of suppliers, producers, customers, market-makers, and market players Nearly every product or service that begins with the word “smart” or “personalised”, every internet- enabled device, every “digital assistant”, is simply a

However, inference attacks on such traces can reveal private information including home addresses and schedules. We asked 32 participants from 12 households to collect 2 months of GPS data, and showed it to them in visualizations. We explored if they understood how their individual privacy concerns mapped onto 5 location obfuscation schemes (which they largely did), which obfuscation schemes they were most comfortable with (Mixing, Deleting data near home, and Randomizing), how they monetarily valued their location data, and if they consented to share their data publicly. 21/32 gave consent to publish their data, though most households’ members shared at different levels, which indicates a lack of awareness of privacy interrelationships. Grounded in real decisions about real data, our findings highlight the potential for end-user involvement in obfuscation of their own location data.","anonymization, computational location privacy, location, obfuscation, privacy",DSCS,"research, user, study, social, question, design, model, theory, information, qualitative",Data Research

Complicated problems originate from causes that can be individually distinguished; they can be addressed piece by piece; for each input to the system there is a proportionate output; the relevant systems can be controlled and the problems they present admit permanent solutions Complex problems and systems result from networks of multiple interacting causes that cannot be individually distinguished; must be addressed as entire systems, that is they cannot be addressed in a piecemeal way; they are such that small inputs may result in disproportionate effects; the problems they present cannot be solved once and for ever, but require to be systematically managed and typically any intervention merges into new problems as a result of the interventions dealing with them; and the relevant systems cannot be controlled Roberto Poli () A Note on the Difference Between Complicated and Complex Social Systems Department of Sociology and Social Research, University of Trento; https://wwwcadmusjournalorg/files/pdfreprints/volissue/repr int-cj-v-i-complex-vs-complicated-systems-rpolipdf Complex or complicated?

• Causality Complicated: Linear cause-and-effect pathways allow us to identify individual causes for observed effects Complex: Because we are dealing with patterns arising from networks of multiple interacting (and interconnected) causes, there are no clearly distinguishable cause-and-effect pathways Implications: Root cause analysis is largely a waste of time in a complex system Complex or complicated? • Linearity Complicated: Every output of the system has a proportionate input ie Newtonian physics apply Complex: Outputs are not proportional or linearly related to inputs; small changes in one part of the system can cause sudden and unexpected outputs in other parts of the system or even system-wide reorganization Implications: Small safe-to-fail experiments are more useful than large projects designed to be fail-safe Complex or complicated? • Reducibility Complicated: We can decompose the system into its structural parts and fully understand the functional relationships between these parts in a piecemeal way Complex: One cannot assume that one structure has one function as the structural parts of the system are multifunctional ie the same function can be performed by different structural parts These parts are also richly inter-related ie they change one another in unexpected ways as they interact We can therefore never fully understand these inter-relationships Implications: Complex systems are emergent, they are greater than the sum of their parts … we need to interact with the system in order to be able to influence it, and we also need to understand that our mere presence is already changing it Our attempts to reduce and re-arrange will fundamentally change or even destroy the system properties Complex or complicated? • Controllability and solvability Complicated: Systemic contexts and interactions can be controlled, and the problems they present can be diagnosed and permanently solved Complex: Complex problems present as emergent patterns resulting from dynamic interactions between multiple non-linearly connected parts In these systems, we’re rarely able to distinguish the real problem, and even small and well-intentioned interventions may result in disproportionate and unintended consequences Implications: These systems are prone to high levels of surprise, uncertainty; and interventions (even simply observing the system) causing unexpected changes and even new or worse challenges We need to shift from “problem & solution” thinking to “patterns & evolution” This serves as a particular challenge to the Design Thinking community Complex or complicated? • Constraints (Openness) Complicated: the reason why the “one structure-one function” assumption is valid in complicated systems is that their environments are delimited ie governing constraints are in place that allows the system to interact only with selected or approved types of systems Functions can be delimited either by closing the system (no interaction) or closing its environment (limited or constrained interactions) Complex: complex systems are open systems, to the extent that it is often difficult to determine where the system ends and another start Complex systems are also nested they are part of larger scale complex systems, eg an organisation within an industry within an economy It is therefore impossible to separate the system from its context Implications: Context matters, ignore it at your peril As soon as organisations become too internally focused, the naval gazing makes them vulnerable Making sure that adequate and diverse feedback mechanisms are in place is a key strategic imperative Complex or complicated? • Knowability Complicated: Because those systems are closed and can be deconstructed can be fully known or modeled Complex: The only valid model of a complex system is the system itself The complexity of a system is not dependent on the amount of available data or knowledge We cannot transform complex systems into complicated ones by spending more time and resources on collecting more data or developing better theories Implications: The only way to truly understand a system is to interact with it Data has seduced many decision-makers … comfortable in their ivory towers, they make decisions with far-reaching consequences without having any real understanding of the potential impact of these decisions Big data is one way to understand egcustomers Its value is also limited: big data can tell where I’m going, when, how much I am spending and the payment methods I use … but it cannot tell why I am doing and my motivations Complex or complicated? • Creativity and adaptability Complicated: complicated systems need an external force to act on them in order to introduce change Complex: these systems are able to observe themselves, learn and adapt Implications: complex systems are adaptive and able to learn In human complex systems intentionality, identity constructs and intelligence also play a role People tend to resist re-organisations, top-down change initiatives and the introduction of new ways of work that include new roles like SCRUM These all lead to a disruption of social dynamics and structures that can have significant unintended consequences eg people can pretend to conform, but sabotage the change process in subtle ways But similarly, given the right enabling constraints, and freedom to adapt in context-relevant ways, the people in these systems can be mobilised to evolve in unexpectedly beneficial ways Complexity and reduction Let’s consider this: Story is a function to reduce complexity in a given information context by aligning the goals and agenda of the presenter with the perceptive capabilities of the receiver Use story as a means to communicate the pros and cons of “sustainability",complexity complex problem implications https problems interactions ways data constraints,DSCS,"system, intelligent_interactive, information, relationship, knowledge, base, design, network, structure, communication",Intelligent Systems

Decision-makers commonly mistake complex systems for simply compli- cated ones and look for solutions without realizing that ‘learning to dance’ with a complex system is definitely different from ‘solving’ the problems arising from it. The situation becomes even worse as far as modern social systems are concerned. This article analyzes the difference between complicated and complex systems to show that (1) what is at stake is a difference of type, not of degree; (2) the difference is based on two different ways of under- standing systems, namely through decomposition into smaller parts and through functional analysis; (3) complex systems are the generic, normal case, while complicated systems are highly distinctive, special, and therefore rare.",complexity complex science difference problems sciences physics framework analysis properties,DSCS,"system, intelligent_interactive, information, relationship, knowledge, base, design, network, structure, communication",Intelligent Systems

Observed values of the potential outcomes are revealed by the assignment mechanism?a probabilistic model for the treatment each unit receives as a function of covariates and potential outcomes. Fisher made tremendous contributions to causal inference through his work on the design of randomized experiments, but the potential outcomes perspective applies to other complex experiments and nonrandomized studies as well. As noted by Kempthorne in his 1976 discussion of Savage's Fisher lecture, Fisher never bridged his work on experimental design and his work on parametric modeling, a bridge that appears nearly automatic with an appropriate view of the potential outcomes framework, where the potential outcomes and covariates are given a Bayesian distribution to complete the model specification. Also, this framework crisply separates scientific inference for causal effects and decisions based on such inference, a distinction evident in Fisher's discussion of tests of significance versus tests in an accept/reject framework. But Fisher never used the potential outcomes framework, originally proposed by Neyman in the context of randomized experiments, and as a result he provided generally flawed advice concerning the use of the analysis of covariance to adjust for posttreatment concomitants in randomized trials",Analysis of covariance; Assignment-based causal inference; Assignment mechanism; Bayesian inference; Direct causal effects; Fieller-Creasy;,DSP,"model, method, system, factor, experiment, uf, variable, quantitative_research, time, parameter",System Modelling

In the course of performing an EFA, researchers often base the decision of how many factors to retain on the eigenvalues for the factors. However, many researchers do not realize that eigenvalues, like all sample statistics, are subject to sampling error, which means that confidence intervals (CIs) can be estimated for each eigenvalue. In the present article, we demonstrate two methods of estimating CIs for eigenvalues: one based on the mathematical properties of the central limit theorem, and the other based on bootstrapping.

Such work can help develop rich insights into various phenomena of interest that cannot be fully understood using only a quantitative or a qualitative method . Notwithstanding the benefits and repeated calls for such work, there is a dearth of mixed methods research in information systems. Building on the literature on recent methodological advances in mixed methods research , we develop a set of guidelines for conducting mixed methods research in IS. We particularly elaborate on three important aspects of conducting mixed methods research: (1) appropriateness of a mixed methods approach ; (2) development of meta-inferences (i.e., substantive theory) from mixed methods research; and (3) assessment of the quality of meta-inferences (i. e. , validation of mixed methods research). The applicability of these guidelines is illustrated using two published IS papers that used mixed methods","Meta-inferences, mixed methods, multimethod, positivist, qualitative, quantitative, research method, research design, validity",DSP,"research, user, study, social, question, design, model, theory, information, qualitative",Data Research

The key question when performing this procedure is how to best estimate the number of factors to retain. This is especially important as under- or over-extraction may lead to erroneous conclusions. Although recent advancements have been made to answer the number of factors question, popular statistical packages do not come standard with these modern techniques. This paper details how to program IBM SPSS Statistics software (SPSS) to conveniently perform five modern techniques designed to estimate the number of factors to retain.

revenue idea article need,-,"Dear students This is a message from Marco van Gelderen, one of the co-teachers in this course I am specialised in teaching so called entrepreneurial soft skills In your course I hold two sessions, one on generating initial ideas for opportunities, one on networking Sessions will be held at the scheduled days and times using either Zoom or Google Hangouts Meet I will use one and the other will be a backup option You will be invited a day in advance Zoom has now been integrated into Canvas For Google Meet, you need to be logged on to Google to be able to use the program You can logon to Google using your VU id and password You can find the software among the Google Apps I hope Zoom / Google Meet will function well even if global demand for internet capacity will surge I realise that not all of you may have optimal internet connections, and the network may become overburdened anyway if so many people are at home and streaming However, attending the sessions is not mandatory and you are capable of understanding the material on your own The sessions are optional extra’s and only attend if you feel like it In terms of knowledge base, these sessions follow the two prescribed articles you can find on my website (wwwenterprisingcompetenciescom), one on generating initial ideas for opportunities, one on networking These articles are easy to read and to understand, and you can email me if you have questions (mwvangelderen@vunl) Lecture-related small assignments (graded pass/fail) I ask you to do one exercise with regard to each session, and hand in the results on Canvas one week after the class is scheduled (or earlier) The results will not be graded, but you need to submit your work in order to be able to pass the course Both reports need to start with a half page summary of the respective article This is to ensure that you have at least browsed through the article By reading the article, you understand the rationale behind the exercise Generating Initial Ideas for Opportunities exercise First, provide a half page summary of the article to be found here: http://wwwenterprisingcompetenciescom/generating-ideashtml The purpose of this exercise is to use the three search directions described in “Generating Initial Ideas for New Venture Opportunities” See Figure  in the article Spend a few hours each on inward and outward active search (passive search is ongoing) Passive search: Be alert in your daily life to experiences such as surprises, frictions, problems, annoyances, incongruities, and successes, and give thought to the new venture opportunities that these might imply Please note as many ideas as you may have, but at least one For each idea, indicate the revenue model in one or two sentences (how will your idea generate money) It can be a social entrepreneurship venture, but they also need to have a revenue model Active search – inward-looking: With this search strategy you proceed from what you love to do (your own passions, dreams, ambitions, fascinations) and what you are very good at (strengths, experience, skills, special knowledge, successes) Then think of ideas to combine the two to create value in other people’s lives Briefly indicate a revenue model (how will your idea generate money) It can be a social entrepreneurship venture, but they also need to have a revenue model Active search – outward-looking: Select a particular market, industry, change, trend, or new (technological) knowledge Then, search and scan for information that is related to whatever has been selected Investigate relevant issues such as consumer needs, trends and changes, innovations, and changing market definitions Finally, attempt to infer an idea for an opportunity from this information Briefly indicate a revenue model (how will your idea generate money) It can be a social entrepreneurship venture, but they also need to have a revenue model Submit your work (which includes one active inward search idea, one active outward search idea, and minimum one passive search ideas on Canvas one week after the date when my session on generating ideas for opportunities was originally planned I will be graded as pass or fail It will pass if the work is complete and serious Keep social distancing in mind when doing this exercise, or any other corona virus related guideline for your behaviour set by the government Networking exercise First, provide a half page summary of the article which you can here: http://wwwenterprisingcompetenciescom/networkinghtml Then provide a log with the following columns: “when” “who” “what” “why” You are asked to give something to  of your weak ties This gift can be anything: an inquiry how someone is doing, a cooking recipe, an interesting news article, an offer to help etc Try to optimise the value you create for the other person, for example by tying your gift to what you know about that person (eg, do not send a cooking recipe to someone who dislikes cooking) Keep social distancing in mind – most likely conduct these acts of giving digitally In the log, list the date (“when”), the recipient (“who”), the gift (“what”) and the reason why you choose that gift particularly for that person (“why”) Submit your work on Canvas one week after the date when my session on networking was originally planned I will be graded as pass or fail It will pass if the work is complete and serious Keep social distancing in mind when doing this exercise, or any other corona virus related guideline for your behaviour set by the government All the best with these

Questions a During the first lecture, also in the PowerPoint presentation of that lecture and in the book by Masurel (), two kinds of entrepreneurial motivation were dealt with: Necessity Driven; Push; Forced versus Opportunity Driven; Pull; Free Which of the two entrepreneurial motivations, according to you, leads to the best entrepreneurial performance? Why? b Which two factors are the main influencers of the relationship between entrepreneurial motivation and entrepreneurial performance? Explain your answers briefly c What is fluid entrepreneurial motivation? Answer this sub‐question on the basis of the two kinds of entrepreneurial motivation under sub‐question a a In the book by Masurel (; Section ), three different roles that an entrepreneur can play are distinguished: professional, leader, and manager Connect each of these four roles to one of the four stages in the life cycle of the firm b Each stage of the life cycle of the firm also has its own firm characteristics Describe how sales diversification and employment dispersion change during the life cycle of the firm c Does the change of the different roles that an entrepreneur plays during the different stages of the life cycle of the firm influence the change of the firm characteristics, or is the situation reversed: does the change of the firm characteristics during the life cycle of the firm influence the change of the different roles that an entrepreneur plays? Give your answer in the form of a small essay, in which you defend one clear, non‐ambiguous proposition Use about  words a During the lecture on  April, sustainable entrepreneurship was defined as ‘leading the organization by making balanced choices between profit, people and planet’ Added to this definition was “beyond compliance”, meaning that sustainable entrepreneurship is going beyond complying to rules and regulations in the field of sustainability However, also four ‘buts’ were mentioned during this lecture, one of them was ISDS (investor‐state dispute settlement) Describe in about  words how an ISDS can influence sustainable entrepreneurship b The paper by Choongo () focused on ‘A longitudinal study of the impact of Corporate Social Responsibility on firm performance in SMEs in Zambia’ His main finding was that this impact was positive To what extent did the regional environment in which he collected his data play a role for his main finding? c Do you expect that the current COVID‐ Crisis will influence the exercising of sustainable entrepreneurship by small businesses?

Ideal datasets Example  \x0c •Medical records of patients in a hospital(eg MIMIC-III) •Information varies depending on source – •Hospital to hospital, doctor to doctor… Real world datasets Example  \x0c Real world datasets Example  •Twitter data obtained Twitter API keys in the  US election •Continuous stream of twitter data (eg) containing certain hashtags •Contains both useful and non-useful information •Consider how tweets from eg bots can contaminate an analysis \x0c •Depends on intention! •You have to become familiar with prior work •Try to map your problem to methods (traditional and/or research) •Prepare your dataset so as to be compatible How do you work on real world data? \x0c •When preparing an analysis you must usually: •Source it •Clean it •Structure it •Further final step could also be ‘label it’ •Depends heavily on the task at hand Are there general rules? \x0c •Thought experiment (is related to, but is notthe assignment): •You are a data scientist researcher for a political party •You have been tasked with ‘analysing online information’ •Try to inform decision making in the party relating to campaigning •Model how the campaign is going, what impressions people have •What information can you get that is useful? •Where and how would you get it? •What would you do with it? Sourcing the data \x0c •Where: Polling trackers eg realclearpolitics •How: Web scraping eg scrapy, BeautifulSoup Sources of data Polls \x0c Sources of data Demographics •Where: Gov Stats Eg US Census Bureau •How: Downloadable Can simply get csv files \x0c •Where: public social media eg Twitter or Reddit •How: API/Scraping eg Twitter streaming API Sources of data Textual Social Media \x0c Sources of data Image based media? •Where: image based social media eg Flickr or Instagram •How: API/Scraping eg Flickr API (Instagram harder) •Need feature extraction –covered in applied ML course \x0c Sources of data Video based media?? •Where: video based social media eg Youtube •How: API/Scraping eg Pytube •Needs both feature extraction and methods for giant datasets \x0c •Need to extract data from a source •Three methods you will use regularly: •) Simple provisions •Eg Excel/CSV/JSON downloads •JSON ~human readable format consisting of key-value(s) pairs •) Through an API •Eg RESTful API (stateless, usually client-server type API with http requests) •) Web crawling / scraping •Crawling : indexing all the available information on a website •Scraping : extracting some specific set of information on a website •And now some examples… Data gathering \x0c •Generally possible from statistics bodies •Government agencies a common example •Most common formats: csv, json, xml, xlsx •Can all be read by Pandas –example in stand ndwerkcollege Data gathering Simple Provisions \x0c •Application Programming Interface •Set of defined communication routines •Allows data to be passed between different programs •Provided by a website…if you are lucky! Data gathering API methods \x0c •Sometimes even nice packages to use a website’s API •We’ll come back to this slide later Data gathering API methods \x0c •No download or API for a dataset…a worked example Data gathering Scraping \x0c •For example -want to get tabular website data into Pandas Data gathering Scraping/Crawling \x0c •Can find data through the HTML of a website •Right-click and ‘View Page Source’ to see a page’s layout •Search through manually to find the data of interest •Then parse the HTML in Python using ‘Beautiful Soup’ •More automated (but a bit more complicated) tool: ‘Scrapy’ Adapted from https://pypiorg/project/realclearpolitics/ by Anthony Bloomer Data gathering Scraping \x0c •Once you have the dataset, need to convert to usable format •In this case it was all elements in an HTML defined table •Make a list where each list entry is a row in the table •Take care of complications with mobile/desktop versions Data gathering Scraping/Crawling \x0c •…et voila Data gathering Scraping/Crawling \x0c •Need to put data in a usable format •Common challenges once data is obtained: Data preparation/cleaning \x0c •Need to put data in a usable format •Common challenges once data is obtained: •Uncertain/multiple entries •Example: Desktop/mobile entries Data preparation/cleaning \x0c •Need to put data in a usable format •Common challenges once data is obtained: •Uncertain/multiple entries •Example: Desktop/mobile entries •Bad entries •Example: NaNs Data preparation/cleaning \x0c •Need to put data in a usable format •Common challenges once data is obtained: •Uncertain/multiple entries •Example: Desktop/mobile entries •Bad entries •Example: NaNs •Mixed formats •Example: Comparing tables of different columns names Data preparation/cleaning \x0c •Need to put data in a usable format •Common challenges once data is obtained: •Uncertain/multiple entries •Example: Desktop/mobile entries •Bad entries •Example: NaNs •Mixed formats •Example: Comparing tables of different columns names •Missing entries/subsets •Example: loading multiple datasets into one dataframe, one is not loaded Data preparation/cleaning \x0c •Need to put data in a usable format •Common challenges once data is obtained: •Uncertain entries •Example: Desktop/mobile entries •Bad entries •Example: NaNs •Mixed formats •Example: Comparing tables of different columns names •Missing entries/subsets •Example: loading multiple datasets into one dataframe, one is not loaded •Un-neccessarydata entries •Example: Duplicate entries in the dataset Data preparation/cleaning \x0c •Easy to drop columns in Pandas with drop() Adapted from https://realpythoncom/python-data-cleaning-numpy-pandas/by Malay Agarwal Data preparation Pandas tools \x0c •Can clean string data with strand regular expressions Adapted from https://realpythoncom/python-data-cleaning-numpy-pandas/by Malay Agarwal Data preparation Regular Expressions \x0c •What are regular expressions? •Sequences of characters that define a text pattern •Follows syntax list: https://wwwrexeggcom/regex-quickstarthtml •‘r’ symbol here actually not really related to regular expressions •It means ‘raw string literal’ •Mostly for Python x, treats backslashes differently Data preparation Regular expressions \x0c •Can implement arbitrary function with apply() •Allows bespoke data cleaning, rather than just regular expressions Adapted from https://realpythoncom/python-data-cleaning-numpy-pandas/by Malay Agarwal Data preparation Pandas tools \x0c Data splitting •Standard practice is to split the dataset •Many example splittings(eg //, //) •Really depends on your dataset •Validation dataset –tuning hyperparameters •Test set –‘blind’ until final result \x0c Data splitting •But why do this? Why three datasets? •Consider case of hand-tuning model choice •Eg I can choose from one of  machine learning models •I try them all on the validation set, then pick the best one •Was this fair? NO!! •Need a ‘blind’ dataset on which you publish the final result! \x0c •If you don’t do this, you will probably end up P-hacking! •Read: tried  models, just showed the one that worked •Train-val-test split canoftenavoid much of this problem •With sequential data –actually much harder to avoid •Train-test-validation split would not have helped in the above-right case Data splitting \x0c •Frequently, dataset is simply too big •Eg Youtube-M,  million youtubevideos •Hundreds of terrabytes, even compressed rep still  TB •Random subsettingis the usual approach BUT •Again, often more difficult for time-series (/sequential) data Reducing the dataset \x0c Break \x0c Twitter data Streaming API Image: Twitter Platform,  •Twitter’s streaming API works as the name suggests •Receive constant stream of tweets as they occur •REST API different: send requests -return (historical) selection \x0c Twitter data API Key •Twitter changed their terms of use •Now have to write a request for a developer account •Please don’t waste too much time on it •I premade a file using the API for you to play with next week anyway \x0c Twitter data API Key •Need to generate the keys through the web portal •Username→ Apps → BasicTwitterScraperdetails → keys and tokens •Generate the tokens, copy and paste to relevant section in notebook \x0c •Python packages: •Twitter API Client tweepy •Twitter API in Python •If using ‘pip install’, can check out the code on https://pypiorg/ •Natural language tool kit NLTK •Python Topic Modelling Library GENSIM •Pymongo(below) •MongoDB •Document based database, represents (almost) arbitrary structures •Need to install the community server to handle data storage •MongoDB use is optional –relates to storing large volumes of data •Canmake use case processing faster… Twitter data Installs \x0c Twitter data Streaming API listener •A simple listener that grabs streaming tweets •Simply prints what is received… \x0c Twitter data Storing tweets •Data now stored in a text using the default Python file handler \x0c •A single tweet’s data in JSON format •Point is: essentially unreadable without a dedicated parser Twitter data What did we get?

supports and encourages shifting between deductive (hypothesis-based) and inductive (pattern based) reasoning • This is a fundamental change from traditional analysis approaches Inductive reasoning and exploratory data analysis provide a means to form or refine hypotheses and discover new analytic paths Models of reality no longer need to be static They are constantly tested, updated and improved until better models are found wwwamsterdamdatasciencenlFundamentals of datascience \x0c Recall: Insight Characteristics Complex Insight is complex, involving all or large amounts of the given data in asynergistic way, not simply individual data values Insight Relevant Insight is deeply embedded in the data domain, connecting the data to existing domain knowledge and giving it relevant meaning going beyond dry data analysis, to relevant domain impact Qualitative Insight is not exact, can be uncertainand subjective, and can havemultiple levels of resolution Unexpected Insight is often unpredictable, serendipitous, and creative wwwamsterdamdatasciencenlFundamentals of datascience \x0c Analytic reasoning artifacts • Elemental artifacts • Artifacts derived form isolated pieces

Verification – A one to one comparison of a captured biometric with a stored template to verify that the individual is who he claims to be ⇒smartcard, username or ID number (biometric passport) Identification – A one to many comparison of the captured biometric against a biometric database in attempt to identify an unknown individual Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c IIS -Biometric methods A fingerprint in its narrow sense is an impression left by the friction ridges of a human finger Fingerprint identification (dactyloscopy) is the process of comparing two instances of friction ridge skin impressions, to determine whether these impressions could have come from the same individual The skin on the palmar surface of the hands and feet forms ridges, so-called papillary ridges, in patterns that are unique to each individual and which do not change over time Even identical twins (who share their DNA) do not have identical fingerprints Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c IIS -Biometric methods Types of fingerprint patterns (a–b) Loop patterns (c–d) Arch patterns (e–h) Whorl patterns Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c IIS -Biometric methods Fingerprint capture and detection solid-state fingerprint readers optical fingerprint readers The procedure for capturing a fingerprint using a sensor consists of rolling or touching with the finger onto a sensing area, which according to the physical principle in use (optical, ultrasonic, capacitive or thermal) captures the difference between valleys and ridges The quantity and direction of the pressure applied by the user, the skin conditions and the projection of an irregular D object (the finger) onto a D flat plane introduce distortions, noise and inconsistencies in the captured fingerprint image These problems result in inconsistent, irreproducible and non-uniform irregularities in the image [Ross, Dass, Jain, ] => Results of the imaging are different and uncontrollable Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c IIS -Biometric methods Problem: D fingerprint necessary detail Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c IIS -Biometric methods Face detection aims to determine whether or not there are any faces in an image and, if present, return the image location and extent of each face Four categories: • knowledge-based methods use pre-defined rules to determine a face based on human knowledge • feature invariant approaches aim to find face structure features that are robust to pose and lighting variations • template matching methods use pre-stored face templates to judge if an image is a face • appearance-based methods learn face models from a set of representative training face images to perform detection [Yang et al ] Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c IIS -Biometric methods Facial recognition automatically identifies or verifies a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source One of the ways to do this is by comparing selected facial features from the image and a facial database Relevant face features • distance between the eyes, • depth of the eye sockets, • width of the nose, • length of the jab line • shape of the cheekbones • distance between ears • size of ears • distance mouth - nose Establishing reliable measurements requires several different images of someone’s face from a variety of angles Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c IIS -Biometric methods -D This technique uses -D sensors to capture information about the shape of a face This information is then used to identify distinctive features on the surface of a face, such as the contour of the eye sockets, nose, and chin Advantage • not affected by changes in lighting • identification of a face from a range of viewing angles, including a profile view Problem D matching technique remain sensitive to expressions => Treat expressions as isometries Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c IIS -Biometric methods Facial recognition criticism good with full frontal faces and  degrees off, but • profile, is still a problem • poor lighting, • sunglasses, • long hair • objects partially covering the subject’s face • low resolution images • variances in facial expressions (neutral facial expressions in passport photos) No scientific survey yet that face recognition actually increases the detection of suspects Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c IIS -Biometric methods Iris recognition is an authentication method that uses pattern-recognition techniques based on high-resolution images of the irides of an individual\'s eyes A retinal scan is an authentication technique that uses the unique patterns on a person\'s retina to identify them Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c IIS -Biometric methods Iris recognition - Imaging Near Infrared (NIR) imaging emitting  nm wavelength light source (avoids light reflections) NIR imaging provides good quality images, it loses pigment melanin information, which is a rich source of information for iris recognition Visible wavelength (VW) imaging keeps the related chromophore information and, compared to NIR, provides rich sources of information mainly coded as shape patterns in the iris Fusion between the two seemed to be an alternative approach that results in boosting the recognition rate [Hosseini et al ] Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c IIS -Biometric methods The result of the Gabor transformation is a set of complex numbers that carry local amplitude and phase information for the iris image Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems Iris recognition – Operating [John Daugman ,]  identify the concentric circular outer boundaries of the iris and the pupil  transform set of pixels covering the iris into a bit pattern that preserves the information essential for a statistical comparison between two iris images => Gabor wavelet transform (extract the spatial frequency range that contains a signal-to-noise ratio considering the focus quality of available cameras)  authenticate via identification (one-to-many template matching) or verification (one-to-one template matching), a template created by imaging the iris is compared to a stored value template in a database If the Hamming distance is below the decision threshold, a positive identification has effectively been made \x0c IIS -Biometric methods Iris recognition – Operating A practical problem of iris recognition is that the iris is usually partially covered by eyelids and eyelashes In order to reduce the false-reject risk in such cases, additional algorithms are needed to identify the locations of eyelids and eyelashes and to exclude the bits in the resulting code from the comparison operation Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c IIS -Biometric methods Iris recognition - Pros • It is an internal organ that is well protected against damage and wear • The iris is mostly flat, and its geometric configuration is only controlled by two complementary muscles • The iris has a fine texture that is unique even among genetically identical individuals • An iris scan is similar to taking a photograph and can be performed from about  cm to a few meters away • The originally commercially deployed irisrecognition algorithm, John Daugman\'s IrisCode, has an unprecedented false match rate (better than −) Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c IIS -Biometric methods Iris recognition – Cons • Iris recognition is very difficult to perform at a distance larger than a few meters and if the person to be identified is not cooperating by holding the head still and looking into the camera •Aswith other photographic biometric technologies, iris recognition is susceptible to poor image quality, with associated failure to enroll rates • As with other identification infrastructure (national residents databases, ID cards, etc), civil rights activists have voiced concerns that iris-recognition technology might help governments to track individuals beyond their will Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c IIS -Biometric methods Retinal Scan The network of blood vessels in the retina is so complex that even identical twins do not share a similar pattern The blood vessels within the retina absorb light more readily than the surrounding tissue and are easily identified with appropriate lighting A retinal scan is performed by casting an unperceived beam of low-energy infrared light into a person’s eye as they look through the scanner\'s eyepiece This beam of light traces a standardized path on the retina Because retinal blood vessels are more absorbent of this light than the rest of the eye, the amount of reflection varies during the scan Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c IIS -Biometric methods Retinal Scan Advantages • Low occurrence of false positives • Extremely low (almost %) false negative rates • Highly reliable because no two people have the same retinal pattern •Speedy results: Identity of the subject is verified very quickly Disadvantages • Measurement accuracy can be affected by a disease such as cataracts or severe astigmatism • Scanning procedure is perceived by some as invasive • Not very user friendly • Subject being scanned must be close to the camera

Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems  \x0c Intelligence Individuals differ from one another in their ability to understand complex ideas, to adapt effectively to the environment, to learn from experience, to engage in various forms of reasoning, to overcome obstacles by taking thought Although these individual differences can be substantial, they are never entirely consistent: A given person\'s intellectual performance will vary on different occasions, in different domains, as judged by different criteria Concepts of ""intelligence"" are attempts to clarify and organize this complex set of phenomena Ulric Neisser et al () Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns, American Psychologist, Vol , No  (February ), pp - Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Intelligence Intelligence is a property of the mind including related abilities, such as the capacities for • abstract thought • understanding • reasoning • planning • problem solving • learning • communication Linda S Gottfredson (first published in Wall Street Journal, ) Mainstream science on intelligence: An editorial with  signatories, history, and bibliography Intelligence, Volume , Issue , January-February , Pages - Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Intelligence -Theories • Psychometric approach, Charles Spearman (), is the field of study concerned with the theory and technique of educational and psychological measurement, which includes the measurement of knowledge, abilities, attitudes, and personality traits (IQ – test) • Theory of cognitive development, Jean Piaget , describes the development of intelligence as a continuous process of assimilations and accommodations that lead to increasing expansion of the field of application of schemes, coordination between them, interiorization, and abstraction Piaget described four main periods or stages in the development: – sensorimotor stage (perceptions and external actions), – preoperational stage (manipulation of representations and symbols), – concrete operational stage (thinking is logical, but limited to the concrete aspects of the world) and – formal operational stage (concrete operational schemes are coordinated with each other) Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Intelligence -Theories • Multiple intelligences, proposed by Howard Gardner in , covers nine accepted intelligences: Spatial, Linguistic, Logicalmathematical, Bodily-kinesthetic, Musical, Interpersonal, Intrapersonal, Naturalistic, Existential • Triarchic theory of intelligence, Robert Sternberg , describes three fundamental aspects of intelligence: analytic intelligence (mental), creative intelligence (novel), and practical intelligence (socio-cultural) • Emotional intelligence, Edward Thorndike  and Daniel Goleman , is a composite of general intelligence and agreeableness, one of the five dimensions of personality in the five- factor model of personality (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Intelligence -Theories • PASS theory, JP Das , is based on a description of neuropsychological processes The PASS model covers four kinds of competencies that are associated with areas of the brain: – The planning processes involve decision making, problem solving, and performing activities and requires goal setting and self-monitoring – The attention/arousal component involves selectively attending to a particular stimulus, ignoring distractions, and maintaining vigilance – Simultaneous processing involves the integration of stimuli into a group and requires the observation of relationships – Successive processing involves the integration of stimuli into serial order Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Intelligent Interactive Systems – Knowledge \x0c IIS -Tasks • IIS perform one or more tasks • IIS operate in a dynamic environment • IIS interact with humans • IIS should be social • IIS (sometimes) learn • IIS are (sometimes) autonomous Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c IIS perform tasks • Example tasks: – Tour guide (eg mobile phone, semantic tourist guide, museum guide) – Route planning (Tom Tom) – Give advice (medication, exercise, how to use ATM) – Control (environment, vehicles, household equipment) – Perform routine tasks (cleaning, getting coffee, delivering mail) – Monitor user activities (elderly care) – Teach (eg English on a mobile phone, serious games) – Help in disaster areas (Urban Search and Rescue tasks) • Often well understood (AI) reasoning methods Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Data and Information (Liew (), Schreiber et al ()) Data refers to groups of information that represent the qualitative or quantitative attributes of a variable or set of variables Information in its most restricted technical sense, is an ordered sequence of symbols As a multi-faceted concept of information in terms of signs and signal-sign systems it represents meaning in terms of four inter-dependent levels: pragmatics, semantics, syntax, and empirics C E Shannon’s Information theory () involving the quantification of information to find fundamental limits on signal processing operations such as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicating data => Entropy Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Knowledge Knowledge (Schreiber et al ()) Knowledge is the whole body of data and information that people bring to bear to practical use in action, in order to carry out tasks and create new information Knowledge adds two distinct aspects: first a sense of purpose, since knowledge is the “intellectual machinery” used to achieve a goal; second , a generative capability, because one of the major functions of knowledge is the procedure of new information Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Knowledge Knowledge (Definitions) Knowledge is the whole body of data and information that people bring to bear to practical use in action, in order to carry out tasks and create new information Knowledge adds two distinct aspects: first a sense of purpose, since knowledge is the “intellectual machinery” used to achieve a goal; second, a generative capability, because one of the major functions of knowledge is to produce new information (Schreiber et al , p ) Knowledge is stable because the essential properties of objects are knowable and relatively unchanging The important metaphysical assumption of objectivism is that the world is real, it is structured, and that structure can be modelled for the learner Objectivism holds that the purpose of the mind is to ""mirror"" that reality and its structure through thought processes that are analyzable and decomposable The meaning that is produced by these thought processes is external to the understander, and it is determined by the structure of the real world (Jonassen , p) Frank

Epistemology Deals with: ! the philosophical analysis of the nature of knowledge and how it relates to such concepts as truth, belief, and justification ! various problems of skepticism, ! the sources and scope of knowledge and justified belief, ! the criteria for knowledge and justification Ontology The study of the nature of being, becoming, existence or reality as well as the basic categories of being and their relations Deals with questions concerning what entities exist or may be said to exist and how such entities may be grouped, related within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to similarities and differences Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Knowledge Epistemology (Truncellito ()) Belief The kind of belief usually addressed within epistemology is that when ""to believe something"" simply means any cognitive content held as true Truth Criteria of truth are standards and rules (verification tools) used to judge the accuracy of statements and claims Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Knowledge Epistemology (source of knowledge) Internalism All knowledge-yielding conditions are within the psychological states of those who gain knowledge Externalism Factors deemed outside of the psychological states of those who gain knowledge Justification Knowledge is explained or defined in some way According to the Socratic theory that knowledge is justified true belief, in order to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition, but one must also have a good reason for doing so => Gettier Problem Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Knowledge Knowledge acquisition A priori knowledge that is gained independently of experience (non-empirical) Authority Intuition Rationalism (acquired by processes, in the form of concepts not derived from experience) A posteriori knowledge that is known by experience Empiricism (experimental inquiry based on perceptual observations by the five senses) Constructivism (contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience) Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Constructivism – one approach on knowledge Constructivism proposes a new paradigm for knowledge and truth, based on inter-subjectivity instead of the classical objectivity and viability of truth Knowledge is subjective And so is reality => Radical Consructivism ""To the constructivist, concepts, models, theories, and so on are viable if they prove adequate in the contexts in which they were created"" (von Glaserfeld, , p) Knowledge is situated Knowledge is grounded in action (Brown et al ) Knowledge is co-constructed through social and cultural communities of practice (Lave & Wenger ) People are situated, embodied agents (Brooks ) Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Constructivism – one approach on knowledge Knowledge is distributed Distributed cognition (Hutchins , Norman ) Belief Systems Cultures World knowledge (common sense knowledge) Consciousness Subconscious processing essential for functioning Emotion/affect Emotion and cognition are intertwined Stories and narratives Interaction Social animal Embodied in the world Social constructivism unifying heterogeneous knowledge sources (Vygotsky , Piaget ) Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Crotty, M,  Foundations of social research: Meaning and Perspective in the Research Process p Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Knowledge Situated knowledge Specific to a particular situation, based on • trial and error • learning from experience => often embedded in language, culture, or traditions Frank Nack Partial Knowledge Knowledge is often not complete (partial) Most real problems have to be solved by taking advantage of a partial understanding of the problem context and problem data Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Knowledge Domain Knowledge A specific (expert) knowledge valid for a pre-selected area (eg art, biology, surgery) The nature of such knowledge is usually declarative Procedural Knowledge Knowledge that is exercised in the accomplishment of a task, and thus includes knowledge which, unlike declarative knowledge, cannot always be easily articulated by the individual, since it is typically non-conscious Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Knowledge representation in AI What is a knowledge representation (KR) (Davis, Shrobe, and Szolovit ) It is a fragmentary theory of intelligent reasoning, expressed in terms of three components: • the representation’s fundamental conception of intelligent reasoning; • the set of inferences the representation sanctions; • the set of inferences it recommends https://daifmphunibask/~sefranek/kri/handbook/handbook_of_krpdf Frank

ie, the computational environment in which thinking is accomplished It is a medium of human expression, ie, a language in which we say things about the world Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Knowledge representation in AI General methods Specialised representations Knowledge applications Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Knowledge representation – General methods Classical logic (propositional, first and second order, theorem proving, etc) Semantic networks and frames (set of terminals to which other structures can be attached) Description logics (concept description of a domain, atomic concepts and atomic roles) Constraints satisfaction (a set of variables, each with some domain values, a set of relations (constraints) on a subset of these variables) Conceptual graphs (a graph representation for logic based on semantic networks) Belief revision (beliefs are represented as sentences of a formal language and belief sets as theories of this language) Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Knowledge representation – General methods Qualitative modelling (representation and reasoning about continuous aspects of motion, space and time – common sense modelling) Baysian networks (a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independencies via a directed acyclic graph) Scripts and cases (stereotypical representations of situations and problems) Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Knowledge representation – Special forms Temporal representations (eg Allen\'s temporal logic) Qualitative spatial representations (symbolic representations of spatial entities, shapes and their parts) Situation calculus (a logical language for representing changes) Event calculus (a

they are the behavioral and nonverbal (Cbehj cues that a person initiates and controls himself The jagged lines (VVVV) at each end of these sets of cues illustrate the fact that the number of available cues is probably without limit Note also the valence signs (+, , or -) that have been attached to public, private, and behavioral cues They indicate the potency or degree of attractiveness associated with the cues Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Communication – exchange of symbols • a process of transferring information from one entity to another • is sign-mediated interaction between at least two agents • both agents share a repertoire of signs and semiotic rules p cpp c Reality Description Sign Repertoires p = perceive c = conceive Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Communication – exchange of symbols A processes of information transmission governed by three levels of semiotic rules: Syntactic formal properties of signs and symbols Reality Description Pragmatic the relations between signs/expressions and their users p = perceive c = conceive Semantic relationships between signs and symbols and what they represent p cpp c Sign Repertoires Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c Communication – sign interpretation [Saussure, ] Concept Mental Perception of Media SIGN beauty Signifier Signified Frank Nack Intelligent Interactive Systems \x0c  SIGN Representamen (symbol) Object (referent) Interpretant (thought) active process physical or mental entity? psychological or ontological status? referred to on a particular occasion? typical or ideal representation?

A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse — definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects — is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms.",,IO,"system, intelligent_interactive, information, relationship, knowledge, base, design, network, structure, communication",Intelligent Systems

University of Sheffield, NLP Module : Ontologies and Semantic Annotation © The University of Sheffield, - This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike Licence University of Sheffield, NLP Why ontologies in GATE? ● Semantic annotation: rather than just annotating the word “Cambridge” as a location, link it to an ontology instance ● Differentiate between Cambridge, UK and Cambridge, Mass ● Semantic search via reasoning ● So we can infer that this document mentions a city in Europe ● Ontologies tell us that this particular Cambridge is part of the country called the UK, which is part of the continent Europe ● Knowledge source ● If I want to annotate strikes in baseball reports, the ontology will tell me that a strike involves a batter who is a person ● In the text “BA went on strike”, using the knowledge that BA is a company and not a person, the IE system can conclude that this is not the kind of strike it is interested in University of Sheffield, NLP Information Extraction for the Semantic Web  Traditional IE is based on a flat structure, eg recognising Person, Location, Organisation, Date, Time etc  For the Semantic Web, we need information in a hierarchical structure  Idea is that we attach semantic metadata to the documents, pointing to concepts in an ontology  Information can be exported as an ontology annotated with instances, or as text annotated with links to the ontology University of Sheffield, NLP Information Extraction for the Semantic Web  Traditional IE is based on a flat structure, eg recognising

Ontology-based IE () John lives in London He works there for Polar Bear Design University of Sheffield, NLP How does ontology-based IE help with IE? • We can make inferences about all kinds of things once we have the annotations linked to an ontology • We now know that cities can have airports, and people have phone numbers • Since John is a man, we know he can have a wife • If we know that the London, where John lives, is in England, we know that Polar Bear Design is also in England and not Ontario University of Sheffield, NLP Ontologies are useful for encoding the information found • Enable us to define the concepts we're trying to find in texts – eg, aircraft accident, industrial action • As well as particular instances of these – eg, Qantas flight XYZ crashed on , BA cabin crew were on strike between March -,  • And the relationships between them – eg, the plane that crashed belonged to Qantas and crashed on a specific date University of Sheffield, NLP Using knowledge from the ontology • The ontology tells us that – Industrial action involves airport or airline staff and has a start and end date • It gives a clearly defined schema to annotate against – if you annotate an instance of a strike, then you know this also requires you to annotate the airport/airline affected and the staff on strike • Extra knowledge about the different kinds of properties and the actors involved can help to improve system performance • Backbone for other processes, for example visualising results on a timeline University of Sheffield, NLP Text mining and semantic annotation • Extract structured data from text by – Linking references to entities – Linking entities to their semantic descriptions • Automatic semantic annotation based on IE technology • Attaches metadata to documents, which makes them more useful and more easily processable • They can then be used for searching and hyperlinking, categorising, and monitoring • Adds value to content of libraries, enabling user interaction with content • Enhanced capability for cross-referencing and dynamic document classification University of Sheffield, NLP Some Terminology  Semantic annotation – annotate in the texts all

Properties of Semantic Relationships: Symmetry ()  • SYMMETRY: the order in which the arguments of a binary relationship doesn't matter Homer Simpson => is-married-to => Marge Simpson Marge Simpson => is-married-to => Homer Simpson Properties of Semantic Relationships: Symmetry ()  • Relationships that are symmetric are also called BI-DIRECTIONAL • ASYMMETRIC relationships are those where the order of the arguments matters Homer Simpson => is-parent-of => Bart Simpson Properties of Semantic Relationships: Inverse  • For asymmetric relationships, it is often useful to be explicit about the meaning of the relationship when the order of the arguments in the relationship is reversed • The resulting relationship is called the INVERSE or the converse of the first relationship Properties of Semantic Relationships: Transitivity ()  • TRANSITIVITY: if X and Y have a relationship, and Y and Z have the same relationship, then X also has the relationship with Z Homer Simpson => is-taller-than => Bart Simpson Bart Simpson => is-taller-than => Maggie Simpson IMPLIES THAT Homer Simpson => is-taller-than => Maggie Simpson Properties of Semantic Relationships: Transitivity ()  • Any relationship based on inclusion or ordering is transitive • Ordering includes numerical, alphabetic, and chronological relationships as well as those that imply qualitative or quantitative measurement Properties of Semantic Relationships: Equivalence  • Any relationship that is both symmetric and transitive is an EQUIVALENCE relationship • We often need to assert that a particular class or property has the same meaning as another class or property or that it is generally substitutable for it Ontology  • An ontology defines the concepts used to describe and represent some domain or area of knowledge • To fully understand a domain you need to know class and part-whole inclusion, attribution, equivalence, and many other relationships about and between the resources it contains • Class inclusion relationships form a kind of backbone or framework to which other kinds of relationships attach, creating a network of relationships Analyzing the Definition of Ontology  • The word ontology has been used to describe artifacts with different degrees of structure that differ: • according to how precisely the terms are defined • according to how precisely the relationships among them are expressed • So the simplest ontology is a dictionary • A thesaurus is a somewhat more complex ontology • More complete ontologies are expressed using formal logic-based language TDO Figure  Relationships: The Lexical Perspective Paul Groth Information Organization UvA Slides from Robert J Glushko glushko@berkeleyedu @rjglushko The Lexical Perspective on Relationships  • A prototypical word is the minimal ""meaning bearing"" element of language • Words express concepts and relationships, but not all concepts and relationships have words for them (are ""lexicalized"") • These ""lexical gaps"" differ from language to language • Whereas ""conceptual gaps"" -- the things we can't think of -- may be innate and universal Relationships Among Words / Relationships Among Concepts  • Representing the relationships among words is a task for linguistics and cognitive science • In contrast, representing the relationships among concepts is a task for computer science • Understanding both kinds of relationships is essential for designers of organizing systems Relationships Among Words  • Hyponymy/Hyperonymy • Metonymy • Synonymy • Polysemy • Antonymy Hyponymy/Hyperonymy  • When words encode IS-A or inclusion relationships, the word for the more specific class is the HYPONYM and the other is the HYPERNYM • So there can be a ""lexical hierarchy"" that represents the ""semantic hierarchy"" • Often used to situate ""basic categories"" with respect to superordinate and subordinate categories Hyponymy/Hyperonymy  • A is a hyponym of B if A is a type of B • A robin is a hyponym of bird • A is a hypernym of B if B is a type of A • An animal is a hypernym of bird A Formula for Definitions  hyponym = {adjective+} hypernym {distinguishing clause+} • Robin = Migratory BIRD with clear melodious song, a reddish breast, gray or black upper plumage • Doesn't mention every characteristic of hyponym, only those needed to distinguish from other hyponyms Metonymy  • The lexical representation of or analogy to part-whole or meronymic relationships • Using one aspect of something to stand for the whole • ""Bank"" as building stands for the institution of the ""bank"" • ""The White House released new budget figures today"" Synonymy  • Synonyms are different word forms that can express the same concept • cat, feline, Siamese cat • Absolute synonyms that can always substitute for each other probably don't exist • Propositional synonyms are those where substituting one for another isn’t likely to change the truth value of the statement Polysemy  • Many ""word forms"" (particular spelling patterns) are polysemous with multiple senses established in the language -- they are semantically ambiguous - That dog has floppy ears - She has a good ear for jazz • ""bank"" (financial) has related senses: - a building (the bank on Shattuck) - specific financial firm (Wells Fargo) - where money is kept (abstract notion) - where anything of value is kept (more abstract) Polysemy vs Homonymy  • A HOMOGRAPH is a word with multiple senses that are not conceptually related - bank (financial sense) - bank (river sense) • But what looks like homography may be polysemy from a historical perspective - mole (an animal that digs holes; an infiltrating spy) • HOMOPHONES are words with the same pronunciation but different spellings and meanings - to, two, too; might, mite; clawed, claude Antonymy  • Antonyms are lexical opposites • Some are inherently binary “true antonyms” • dead / alive, true / false, on / off • Others are ""graded"" • long / short, hot / cold • Markedness: if one member of a pair is more restricted in its contexts it can stand out psychologically • long is unmarked, short is marked Thesauri  • A THESAURUS is a tool for finding the ""right"" or ""good"" terms of a controlled vocabulary • It is a collection of vocabulary terms annotated with lexical relationships to indicate terms that are: • Preferred (UF ""used for"") • Broader (BT ""broader term"") • Narrower (NT ""narrower term"") • Related (RT ""related term"" or ""see also"") • USE in a thesaurus refers the reader from a variant term to a preferred term; the inverse of UF Implications for Vocabulary Design  • Choosing vocabulary terms, and precisely defining their semantics, is essential but impossible to do perfectly • Your vocabulary must express what YOU intend, so you ""look inward"" -- analyze how you think about a domain • You want others to understand what you mean, so you need to ""look outward"" -- analyze the terms used by your users, competitors, or subject matter experts • You should reuse other vocabularies or thesauri if they exist, especially for any ""horizontal"" components, to improve transformability and interoperability • But these three approaches may suggest different terms https://wordnetprincetonedu Relationships: The Structural Perspective Paul Groth Information Organization UvA Slides from Robert J Glushko glushko@berkeleyedu @rjglushko The Structural Perspective on Relationships  • Analyzing the association, arrangement, proximity, or connection between resources without primary concern for their meaning or the origin of these relationships • Sometimes structure is all we knowand sometimes we ignore what we know about relationship semantics to focus on the generic aspect of structural connectivity Internal and External Structure ()  • Resources can have INTERNAL structure as well as the EXTERNAL structure that connects them to other resources • We often make arbitrary decisions about the granularity with which we describe the internal structure of a resource • The boundaries we impose to identify resources determines whether some structure is internal or external with respect to them Internal and External Structure ()  • Example: How do we describe the relationships between companies? • In terms of the company-to-company transactions they carry out • In terms of the business components/ services that are involved • In terms of the interactions between their employees Making Implicit Structure Explicit  • Some organizing principles impose very little structure and the structure might be implicit • co-location / pile of resources used together • arrangement by frequency of use • Coordinate systems enable absolute description of location, or we can use relative descriptions • in, on, above, below, in front of, behind… • Statistical techniques can make explicit the structure implied by frequency distribution or correlations between properties of resources “Between-Resource” Structures  • Links between printed or digital documents • Links between web pages • Links – communication and information flows - between people, organizations, any other kind of interacting “actors” or resources – social networks • We can analyze all of these with some common concepts and abstractions Between-Document Links From document to document From document component to document component From document component to document From document to document component Within-Document Links From one component to another From document component to contained document component (call out) From document component to document component, pop-up (two-way, mandatory return link) Link Network – Graphical View Link Network – Matrix View Link Properties  • Starting point of the link (the ANCHOR) • The end point of the link (the DESTINATION) • The reason for the link (the LINK TYPE) • The number of resource types (ARITY or DEGREE) or resource instances (CARDINALITY) linked to (- or -many) • The DIRECTIONALITY Meaning from Graph Structure  • Centrality measures • Number of incoming edges • Related nodes • … Relationships: The Architectural Perspective Paul Groth Information Organization UvA Slides from Robert J Glushko glushko@berkeleyedu @rjglushko The Architectural Perspective {and, or, vs} the Structural Perspective  • The architectural perspective is abstract and prescriptive • It defines what kinds of relationships can be created given the design of an organizing system • The structural perspective is concrete and descriptive • It says ""this is what exists"" and describes the actual patterns of association, arrangements, proximity, or connection between resources in a particular context The Architectural Perspective: Degree or Arity  • The architectural perspective embodies Kent’s definition of “relation” as “A sequence of categories, that includes one thing from each category” • The DEGREE or ARITY of a relationship is the number of different ""entity types"" or ""resource categories"" in the relationship • Husband is-married-to Wife is BINARY • Person is-married-to Person is UNARY The Architectural Perspective: Cardinality  • The CARDINALITY is the number of instances that can be associated with each entity type • Husband is-married-to Wife is ONE-TOONE, because husbands have only one wife and vice versa (in monogamous societies) • Father is-parent-of Child is ONE-TO-MANY • Homer is-parent-of Bart AND Lisa AND Maggie is one-to-three Modeling Relationships as Binary Ones  • Relationships can always be modeled as binary ones, but this makes some relationships implicit that were explicit • Binary relationships are relationship ""triples"" with a ""subject"", ""predicate,"" and ""object"" • With binary relationships the reason for the relationship can often be interpreted in both directions (one is the inverse of the other) • With triples we can combine relationships into a graph and ""reason"" over the set of relationships when they have common components The Architectural Perspective: Directionality  • The DIRECTIONALITY of a relationship defines the order in which the arguments of the relationship are connected • A ONE-WAY or UNI-DIRECTIONAL relationship can be followed in only one direction • A BI-DIRECTIONAL one can be followed in both directions • All symmetric relationships are bi-directional, but not all bi-directional relationships are symmetric Relationships: The Implementation Perspective Paul Groth Information Organization UvA Slides from Robert J Glushko glushko@berkeleyedu @rjglushko Choosing an Implementation  • To communicate or process or otherwise use a relationship it needs to be represented in some implementation • The choice of implementation determines how easy it is to represent the relationship, and how easy it then is to understand and process • This means you need to consider the capabilities and biases of the intended users when choosing the implementation Contrasting Implementations (TDO )  • Natural Language • The Simpson family includes a man named Homer and a woman named Marge, the married parents of three sibling children, a boy named Bart and two girls, Lisa and Maggie • Subject-Predicate Syntax • Homer Simpson → is-married-to → Marge Simpson • Homer Simpson → is-parent-of → Bart • XML Syntax <Family name=""Simpson""> <Parents children=""Bart Lisa Maggie""> <Father name=""Homer"" spouse=""Marge"" /> <Mother name=""Marge"" spouse=""Homer"" /> </Parents> <Children parents=""Homer Marge"" > <Boy name=""Bart"" siblings=""Lisa Maggie"" /> <Girl

In other words what is the expressive power that we need given the aims of our research \x0c Remember your previous research method courses… • Qualitative – Quantitative • Inductive – Deductive • … \x0c Statistical models • study the dependency between the variables • best explanation for the variance in variables • Variables and their relationships form a acyclic directed graph!

• “A distinguishable piece of the universe • A system is a potential source of data” (Bernard Ziegler, Theory of Modeling and Simulation, ) What is an EXPERIMENT ? • “An experiment is the process of extracting data from a system by exerting it through its inputs” (François Cellier, Continuous System Modelling, ) What is a SIMULATION? • “A simulation is an experiment performed on a model” (Granino Korn and John Wait, digital continuous system simulation, ) \x0c Systems, experiments, simulation… What is an EXPERIMENTAL FRAME? • “An experimental frame is a specification of the conditions under which the system observed is experimented with” (Bernard Ziegler, Theory of Modeling and Simulation, ) \x0c Mathematical simulation • A mathematical simulation is a coded description of an experiment with a reference to the model to which this experiment is applied • Note the (important) separation between model description and experiment description • Also note the potential danger of this separation; it is very easy to apply an experiment to a model for which the model is not valid System Experiment with Experiment with a the actual system model of the system Mathematical Model Physical Model Analytical Solution Simulation \x0c The Dangers of Simulation Both its strength and weakness: generality and ease of its application… “All too often, simulation is a love story with an unhappy ending We create a model of a system, and then fall in love with it Since love is usually blind, we immediately forget all about the experimental frame, we forget that this is not the real world, but that it represents the world only under a very limited set of experimental conditions (we become ‘model addicts’)” F Cellier, Continuous System Modeling,   \x0c in other words “Don’t fall in love with your model !” Francois Cellier  \x0c A model has limitations • It has a domain of validity • It only represents part of the original system • Its output will not exactly match that of the original system (ie It has a limited accuracy)  \x0c Why is Modeling Important? “Modeling means the process of organizing knowledge about a given system” Bernard Ziegler, Multifaceted Modeling and Discrete Event Simulation,  “ it can thus be said that modeling is the single most central activity that unites all scientific and engineering endeavors While the scientist is happy to simply observe and understand the world, ie, create a model of the world, the engineer wants to modify it to his advantage While science is all analysis, the essence of engineering is design” “ simulation can be used not only for analysis (direct problems) but also for design (inverse problems)” François Cellier, Continuous System Modelling,  \x0c Why model? • The physical system may not be available for experiments • Experiment may be eg too dangerous, unethical, lead to undesirable impact etc • It may be too expensive to experiment in the real world • Time scale of the system is too short/long • Control variables may be inaccessible • … • From reality to in silico experimentation similar to from reality to in vitro… \x0c  reasons to model Explain Predict Optimize Improve Guide experiment Illuminate dynamics Suggest analogies Discover new questions Promote scientific thinking Illuminate uncertainties Crisis management in near-real time Demonstrate tradeoffs Challenge robustness of prevailing theory through perturbations Expose prevailing wisdom as incompatible with available data Support policy dialogue Train practitioners Educate general public Reveal the apparently simple (complex) to be complex (simple) …” Epstein, Joshua M () 'Why Model?'

Originally developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by lay Forrester, system dynamics is a unique method devised to help managers and public policymakers design and implement high leverage policies for sustainable success. In a comprehensive new treatment, John Sterman, a Jeading authority on system dynamics, explains what system dynamics is and how it can be successfully applied to solve business and organizational problems. Business Dynamics includes principles for modelling complex dynamic systems, simulation models, experiential exercises, and case studies of successful applications. The CD-ROM included with the book and the dedicated book website contain the models developed in the text, along with all the software needed to run, test, and extend them, thereby helping to increase student participation in the learning process.",,MSD,"product, service, customer, business, market, opportunity, uf, idea, company, change",Entrepreneurship
